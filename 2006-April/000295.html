Hi Adam,

 &gt; now that i finally got that out of the way ... i have
 &gt; some time look at open record again.

Cool, let me know how I can help.

 &gt; Right now i'm thinking about trying to hack the tableplugin
 &gt; into rhizome.  It'll be messy and not a 100% AJAX-y but
 &gt; this is fastest path i can think of to get something that
 &gt; can actually be used.

Yup, sounds good.  Unfortunately the tableplugin hasn't been designed as
a stand alone component, so there may be a bunch of crude hacking
involved to provide it with an environment that it thinks it can live in.

 &gt;  Here's how I am thinking of implementing this:
 &gt;
 &gt; * map RDF resource to Items
 &gt; ** treat the resource URI as the UUID
 &gt; ** multiple valued entries map to multiple statements with
 &gt; the same attribute as the property
 &gt; ** map orp data types to the XML schema datatypes that RDF uses
 &gt; ** map rdf:type to Category attribute, rdfs:range to
 &gt; ExpectedType, rdfs:label to shortname, rdfs:comment to name
 &gt; ** ignore inverse attributes for now

Yes, those mappings sounds good.  It's not entirely clear to me what the
name/label mappings should be, and I'm not fluent enough in RDF to know
how rdfs:label and rdfs:comment are typically used.  You might think
about mapping rdfs:label to name and rdfs:comment to summary, and then
figuring out something else to do with shortname.

 &gt; * Have the server generate a list of all the items that the
 &gt; table plugin may need to access:
 &gt; Here are the RxPath queries for this, assuming the table
 &gt; contains all resource of given Category/RDF class:
 &gt;
 &gt; ** items = /*[rdf:type=$category]
 &gt; ** attributes = id($items/*)
 &gt; ** expectedTypes = id($attributes/rdfs:range/*)
 &gt; ** suggestedItems = /*[rdf:type = $expectedTypes]
 &gt; ** plus the layout item resource for this table instance

I don't know XPath (or RxPath), but those queries look good as far as I
can tell.

 &gt; * derive an simple archive class from StubArchive. The archive
 &gt; is initialized with only these items (plus it loads the axiomatic
 &gt;  ones). When committing a transaction it converts the items back
 &gt; to RDF (probably in JSON format) and sends it back to the server.

Yup, sounds good.  I'd be interested in talking to you sometime about
different JSON representations for RDF.  I just recently learned that
there are RDF stores that return SPARQL results as JSON, which would be
very convenient for an AJAX app.  I'm curious about other flavors of
JSON/RDF.

 &gt; I'm not sure I understand what records can be in the transaction
 &gt; list: It looks like votes represent items added or removed, Items
 &gt; can be added to the transaction list directly and then there are
 &gt; these Ordinal things that I don't understand.

There are four types of records: Entries, Items, Votes, and Ordinals.

Most records will just be Entries, and most Entries are essentially RDF
statements.

Item records have *only* the UUID of the item, and just serve to state
that the Item exists.  You might be able to get rid of the notion of the
Item record, and simply infer the existence of the Item from the fact
that some Entry is making a statement about it.

A &quot;Vote&quot; (perhaps poorly named) just flags an Item or Entry as having
been deleted by a user, or undeleted again by the same user or another user.

The Ordinal records are a mechanism for representing ordered lists --
ordered lists of items (resources) or ordered list of entries
(statements)...

 &gt; ** multiple valued entries map to multiple statements with
 &gt; the same attribute as the property (this doesn't preserve
 &gt; the order of the values in the entry but its not clear to
 &gt; me if that's part of your model)

I know RDF has some mechanism(s) for representing ordered lists, but I
don't know much about it.  Probably my notion of Ordinal values doesn't
map cleanly to any RDF notion.  The goal with the Ordinal mechanism was
to come up with a representation of the ordering that would work
smoothly with multi-user concurrent access and with a distributed
datastore.  I wanted users to be able to independently move two of
the elements in a list, and then be able to merge those actions later.

So the idea is that each element in a list has an ordinal number --
ordered lists themselves are never explicitly represented -- you can
take any query result set (a set of items/resources or a set of
entries/statements) and view the results as an ordered list simply by
sorting the results based on their ordinal numbers.

 &gt; * write a new View class for containing the plugin view and
 &gt; intializing everything; hack tableplugin, plugin view, entry
 &gt; view, etc. as necessary
 &gt;
 &gt; Does this make sense? Am I missing anything?

Sounds great.  You're all over it.  I can't think of anything you're
missing!
