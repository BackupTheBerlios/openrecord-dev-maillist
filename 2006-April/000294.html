<PRE>Hi everyone,

One of the people who's recently joined the openrecord-dev mailing list 
is Adam Souzis, author of the Rhizome Wiki and the Raccoon RDF-based 
application server.  (More good info at <A HREF="http://www.liminalzone.org/">http://www.liminalzone.org/</A> )

Adam has been digging into the OpenRecord code recently, looking at what 
it would take to get OpenRecord talking to an RDF server, and looking at 
re-using the OpenRecord table view in the Rhizome Wiki.  He and I have 
exchanged a couple messages today, and I thought this thread might be 
interesting to other people on the openrecord-dev list, so with Adam's 
permission I'm including the (slightly abridged) messages here...

hi brian,

thanks... now that i finally got that out of the way (and finished my
paper for the semantic wiki conference) i have some time look at open
record again.

When we last talked i was investigating writing an openrecord json to
RDF converter. But as I dug into the code, i'm reconsidering whether
that's the best starting point. Right now i'm thinking about trying to
hack the tableplugin into rhizome.  It'll be messy and not a 100%
AJAX-y but this is fastest path i can think of to get something that
can actually be used. Here's how I am thinking of implementing this:

* map RDF resource to Items
** treat the resource URI as the UUID
** multiple valued entries map to multiple statements with the same
attribute as the property (this doesn't preserve the order of the
values in the entry but its not clear to me if that's part of your
model)
** map orp data types to the XML schema datatypes that RDF uses
** map rdf:type to Category attribute, rdfs:range to ExpectedType,
rdfs:label to shortname, rdfs:comment to name
** ignore inverse attributes for now

* Have the server generate a list of all the items that the table
plugin may need to access:
Here are the RxPath queries for this, assuming the table contains all
resource of given Category/RDF class:

** items = /*[rdf:type=$category]
** attributes = id($items/*)
** expectedTypes = id($attributes/rdfs:range/*)
** suggestedItems = /*[rdf:type = $expectedTypes]
** plus the layout item resource for this table instance

* derive an simple archive class from StubArchive. The archive is
initialized with only these items (plus it loads the axiomatic ones).
When committing a transaction it converts the items back to RDF
(probably in JSON format) and sends it back to the server. I'm not
sure I understand what records can be in the transaction list: It
looks like votes represent items added or removed, Items can be added
to the transaction list directly and then there are these Ordinal
things that I don't understand.

* write a new View class for containing the plugin view and
intializing everything; hack tableplugin, plugin view, entry view,
etc. as necessary

Does this make sense? Am I missing anything?

cheers,
adam
