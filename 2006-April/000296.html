</I>&gt;<i> From: Brian Douglas Skinner &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openrecord-dev">skinner at dojotoolkit.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> To: Adam Souzis
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Adam,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; now that i finally got that out of the way ... i have
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; some time look at open record again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cool, let me know how I can help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Right now i'm thinking about trying to hack the tableplugin
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; into rhizome.  It'll be messy and not a 100% AJAX-y but
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; this is fastest path i can think of to get something that
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; can actually be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, sounds good.  Unfortunately the tableplugin hasn't been designed as
</I>&gt;<i> a stand alone component, so there may be a bunch of crude hacking
</I>&gt;<i> involved to provide it with an environment that it thinks it can live in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;  Here's how I am thinking of implementing this:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; * map RDF resource to Items
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** treat the resource URI as the UUID
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** multiple valued entries map to multiple statements with
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the same attribute as the property
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** map orp data types to the XML schema datatypes that RDF uses
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** map rdf:type to Category attribute, rdfs:range to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ExpectedType, rdfs:label to shortname, rdfs:comment to name
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** ignore inverse attributes for now
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, those mappings sounds good.  It's not entirely clear to me what the
</I>&gt;<i> name/label mappings should be, and I'm not fluent enough in RDF to know
</I>&gt;<i> how rdfs:label and rdfs:comment are typically used.  You might think
</I>&gt;<i> about mapping rdfs:label to name and rdfs:comment to summary, and then
</I>&gt;<i> figuring out something else to do with shortname.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; * Have the server generate a list of all the items that the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; table plugin may need to access:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Here are the RxPath queries for this, assuming the table
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; contains all resource of given Category/RDF class:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** items = /*[rdf:type=$category]
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** attributes = id($items/*)
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** expectedTypes = id($attributes/rdfs:range/*)
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** suggestedItems = /*[rdf:type = $expectedTypes]
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** plus the layout item resource for this table instance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know XPath (or RxPath), but those queries look good as far as I
</I>&gt;<i> can tell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; * derive an simple archive class from StubArchive. The archive
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; is initialized with only these items (plus it loads the axiomatic
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;  ones). When committing a transaction it converts the items back
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; to RDF (probably in JSON format) and sends it back to the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, sounds good.  I'd be interested in talking to you sometime about
</I>&gt;<i> different JSON representations for RDF.  I just recently learned that
</I>&gt;<i> there are RDF stores that return SPARQL results as JSON, which would be
</I>&gt;<i> very convenient for an AJAX app.  I'm curious about other flavors of
</I>&gt;<i> JSON/RDF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
oh, I haven't heard of any JSON RDF representatioins myself, I'd be
interested looking at that too if you have any references. I was just
planning to do something very simple, e.g. a list of statements in
json like:

[ ['subject', 'predicate', 'object', 'objectType'], etc. ]

which can be &quot;parsed&quot; in one line of Python code:

listOfStatements = [Statement(*s) for s in eval(jsonString)]
the only tricky thing would be escaping the strings

&gt;<i>  &gt; I'm not sure I understand what records can be in the transaction
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; list: It looks like votes represent items added or removed, Items
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; can be added to the transaction list directly and then there are
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; these Ordinal things that I don't understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are four types of records: Entries, Items, Votes, and Ordinals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most records will just be Entries, and most Entries are essentially RDF
</I>&gt;<i> statements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Item records have *only* the UUID of the item, and just serve to state
</I>&gt;<i> that the Item exists.  You might be able to get rid of the notion of the
</I>&gt;<i> Item record, and simply infer the existence of the Item from the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that some Entry is making a statement about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;Vote&quot; (perhaps poorly named) just flags an Item or Entry as having
</I>&gt;<i> been deleted by a user, or undeleted again by the same user or another user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Ordinal records are a mechanism for representing ordered lists --
</I>&gt;<i> ordered lists of items (resources) or ordered list of entries
</I>&gt;<i> (statements)...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ** multiple valued entries map to multiple statements with
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the same attribute as the property (this doesn't preserve
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the order of the values in the entry but its not clear to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; me if that's part of your model)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know RDF has some mechanism(s) for representing ordered lists, but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know much about it.  Probably my notion of Ordinal values doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> map cleanly to any RDF notion.  The goal with the Ordinal mechanism was
</I>&gt;<i> to come up with a representation of the ordering that would work
</I>&gt;<i> smoothly with multi-user concurrent access and with a distributed
</I>&gt;<i> datastore.  I wanted users to be able to independently move two of
</I>&gt;<i> the elements in a list, and then be able to merge those actions later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the idea is that each element in a list has an ordinal number --
</I>&gt;<i> ordered lists themselves are never explicitly represented -- you can
</I>&gt;<i> take any query result set (a set of items/resources or a set of
</I>&gt;<i> entries/statements) and view the results as an ordered list simply by
</I>&gt;<i> sorting the results based on their ordinal numbers.
</I>
ok, i think i get it now. It's a little unusual in that this
establishes a total order over every item and entry -- looking at the
source code, it seems that if an ordinal has not been explicity set,
you use the record's timestamp as the ordinal.

The closest notion RDF has to this is an infinite set of properties
named rdf:_1 through rdf:_n that are uses to establish ordered
relations, but not any sort of global order.  Besides saving the order
of columns in a table, are explicitly ordered relationships used
elsewhere in OpenRecord?

So... to deal with this: when converting an entry to RDF, if an entry
has an explicit ordinal associated with, instead of adding a single
statement, add two statements:

item attribute rdf:Seq
and
rdf:Seq rdf:_&lt;ordinal&gt; value
where rdf:Seq is a blank node whose identifier is derived from
concatenating the item and attribute UUIDs.

&gt;<i>  &gt; * write a new View class for containing the plugin view and
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; intializing everything; hack tableplugin, plugin view, entry
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; view, etc. as necessary
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Does this make sense? Am I missing anything?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds great.  You're all over it.  I can't think of anything you're
</I>&gt;<i> missing!
</I>&gt;<i>
