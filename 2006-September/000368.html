Our old demo page was badly out of date.  We've definitely been remiss 
in not keeping a working demo posted.

We do hope to keep the new demo working.  The demo we have posted now 
allows different people to each make their own copy of the demo 
document, each with its own URL.  You can share that URL with colleagues 
to try out the concurrent editing features.  Those URLs should work for 
at least a few days or a few weeks, although we will need to 
periodically delete old demo documents in order to save disk space.

Over the past couple weeks we've been actively working on the new demo. 
  We hadn't announced the new demo, but we did have a link to it from 
the openrecord.org web site, and people created a few dozen new demo 
documents every day.  As we were working on the demo we needed to 
periodically delete the demo documents that people created, but now that 
we've announced the demo we will no longer be deleting demo documents 
every few days.

We're still at a very pre-alpha stage, and you can expect the current 
demo to be buggy and slow.  But it should basically work -- you should 
be able to go from page to page, add new items, new pages, etc.  If the 
demo isn't working, please do let us know, and we'll try to get it fixed.

We're also interested in bug reports, and bug reports with bug fix 
patches are especially welcome!
