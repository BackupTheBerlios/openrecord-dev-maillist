<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> We don't yet have a real server, so we're not quite at that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stage yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the response.  I'm curious how it supports concurrent
</I>&gt;<i> editing and data persistence without a server. 
</I>
You bet, let me try to describe how it works now...

Right now we're storing all the data on the server in what amounts to 
one long transaction log file.  When you create a new item on the 
client, the JavaScript code creates a little JSON-format text packet 
that describes the transaction.  The client sends that text packet to 
the server, and the server appends the packet to the log file.  Same 
thing whenever a user changes any attribute of any item.

Each new attribute value gets a unique id.  If I edit the Kermit item to 
set the color attribute to &quot;green&quot;, then there will be a new unique id 
associated with that entry, something like this:
  {id:XYZ,
   user:Brian, timestamp:&quot;2006-09-18 16:44:28&quot;,
   item:Kermit, attribute:color, value:&quot;green&quot;}

If you come along and change Kermit's color to &quot;aqua&quot;, that creates a 
new entry, which is marked as a replacement for my old &quot;green&quot; entry:
  {id:QRP, replaces:XYZ,
   user:Jon, timestamp:&quot;2006-09-19 13:11:33&quot;,
   item:Kermit, attribute:color, value:&quot;aqua&quot;}

Let's say there's also another user, Amy.  Amy might also be editing 
Kermit at the same time you are.  Amy would still think Kermit is green, 
because she hasn't yet seen your change.  She might independently change 
Kermit's color from &quot;green&quot; to &quot;blue&quot;.  Her entry looks like this:
  {id:ABC, replaces:XYZ,
   user:Amy, timestamp:&quot;2006-09-19 13:11:33&quot;,
   item:Kermit, attribute:color, value:&quot;blue&quot;}

At this point the transaction log contains all three entries: XYZ, QRP, 
and ABC.  Entry XYZ is no longer considered as binding, since the other 
entries mark XYZ as having been replaced.  But QRP and ABC are both 
still binding, since they were made concurrently and neither one 
replaces the other.  So at this point Kermit is both &quot;aqua&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;. 
  When a new user opens their browser and looks at that page, the 
OpenRecord JavaScript code figures out Kermit's current color by reading 
the entire transaction log and seeing what entries are applicable.

The transaction log approach is not scalable, but it has worked nicely 
for prototyping.  There's a 4-minute section in our screencast that 
shows how this all looks from a user's perspective:

&gt;<i> What are you thinking the server will be written in?
</I>
To get a server up and running quickly, with all the flexible data 
features that we want, I think the best bet is to build on top of Adam 
Souzis's RDF server tools, Racoon and Rx4RDF.  I think those tools are 
written in Python, although I think sites that use those tools can be 
written using RxSLT, XSLT, and RxUpdate.

There's more info at Adam's web site, although the server seems to be 
down right now:
