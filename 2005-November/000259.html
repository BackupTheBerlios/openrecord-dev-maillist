<PRE>I added links from the OpenRecord website to some projects that have 
similar features:
  <A HREF="http://openrecord.org/bookmarks.html#similar">http://openrecord.org/bookmarks.html#similar</A>

The new links include pointers to:
   Google Base
   The Ning Content Store
   Dabble DB
   Dan Bricklan's wikiCalc
   Sproutliner
   Sparrow Web
   MediaWiki projects: Wikidata and the Semantic MediaWiki project
   Daisy CMS
   Intuit QuickBase
   Semantic wiki projects: Platypus, Rhizome, Gnowsis, etc.

Here are some notes about a few of the projects...

--------------------------------------------------
Google Base

Google Base has a data model that's vaguely similar to the OpenRecord 
data model. For example, in Google Base any item can have any number of 
ad-hoc attributes, any attribute can be multi-valued, any date value can 
have an end-date as well as a start-date, and numbers can have units 
(like &quot;meters&quot; or &quot;meters/second&quot;).

However, I think the similarities end there. Google Base seems to be 
oriented toward &quot;monolithic&quot; items, rather than big structures of small 
items -- for example Google Base does not seem to be designed to support 
any type of references between items, or multi-item transactions.

--------------------------------------------------
The Ning Content Store

On the Ning web site there's a nice one-page description of their &quot;Ning 
Content Store&quot;:
   <A HREF="http://developerdocumentation.ning.com/post.php?Post:slug=ContentStore">http://developerdocumentation.ning.com/post.php?Post:slug=ContentStore</A>

Ning uses a custom Content Store that has a data model which is similar 
in many ways to the OpenRecord data model.

A Ning &quot;Content Object&quot; is like an OpenRecord &quot;Item&quot;. The most 
significant similarity is that both Ning and OpenRecord lack any notion 
of pre-defined schema -- any items (content objects) can have any 
attributes. Ning and OpenRecord are also similar in that they both 
support bi-directional references.

However, there are a number of differences. In Ning, each Object can be 
of only one type, and the type of an Object cannot change once the 
Object is created -- OpenRecord has no similar notion. In Ning, an 
attribute is identified by its name (a string) -- in OpenRecord 
attributes are identified by UUID, an attribute can have different names 
in different languages, and each attribute is itself an item, so it can 
have not only a 'name', but also a 'summary' description, and other 
descriptive attributes. Like OpenRecord, Ning allows any attribute to be 
multi-valued, but in Ning all the values of a multi-valued attribute 
must be of the same type. Ning has a notion of public vs. private 
content, whereas OpenRecord treats all content as public. OpenRecord 
includes some support for transactions, whereas Ning generally doesn't.

--------------------------------------------------
Dabble DB

The Dabble web site currently only has a few screenshots, and doesn't 
have much written documentation. So, it's hard to know quite what Dabble 
is, but judging by what is posted it certainly looks like Dabble and 
OpenRecord are both trying to solve the same problems. Their weblog has 
some appealing posts talking about usability and the relationship 
between spreadsheets and databases:
