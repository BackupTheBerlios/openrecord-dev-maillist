<PRE>Hey Joi,

I'm very glad I got a chance to speak with you at the Creative Commons
fundraiser last night.  Thanks for offering to put me in touch with people
at OSI who can help me.

Here's the 2-minute summary of the problem I'm trying to solve.  Feel free
to forward this to other people...

I've started a small open source software project, openrecord.org, with a
few volunteer programmers.  We want to distribute our work with no
restrictions, so that anyone can take all of it, or any small part of it,
and use it for any purpose.  

We've been making the work available using the Creative Commons Public
Domain Dedication (CC-PDD), but unfortunately the CC-PDD only addresses
copyright issues, not patent rights.  We plan to also start making the work
available under the Academic Free License (AFL), which addresses patent
rights and is OSI certified.  

I have never seen a project release code under a dual-license using a
conventional open source license in combination with a public domain
dedication.  So I'm looking for some advice...  Can we do this?  Are we on
solid legal footing?  Is there some simpler alternative?  What language
should we use in the &quot;copyright&quot; statement in our files?

The AFL, like other open source licenses, carries a perpetual attribution
requirement.  If I understand correctly, all derivative works and remixes,
and derivatives of those derivates, forever after, will have to carry the
original copyright notice and an AFL attribution notice.  If all open source
projects used the same license, or if open source projects never borrowed
code from one another, then the attribution notice might not be a big deal.
In practice, I think the attribution requirement is a significant barrier to
free remixing of code.  If someone wants to take 20 lines of code from one
project and mix that in with code from a dozen other projects licensed under
a dozen other licenses, it's simply too much trouble to try to keep track of
exactly which lines of code need to be attributed to whom.  I'd like to
solve that problem.  I'd like to make our code freely available, with no
burden of attribution, and with clear, comprehensive grants of both patent
and copyright rights.  Is a CC-PDD/AFL dual-license a good way to try do
that?

Thanks for your help.

Cheers,
  Brian Skinner
