Hey all,

I'm happy to announce that Hiran Ganegedara is the newest committer on 
the OpenRecord project!

Hiran is working on a set of new plugins for OpenRecord, as part of 
Google's generous Summer of Code program.  Hiran's been hard at work on 
a cool interactive bar chart plugin, with integrated color picker, 
tooltips, drag-resizing, etc.  I think he'll be checking the bar chart 
code into SVN shortly, and he's recently started on a scatter plot 
plugin as well, with other plugins to follow.

Hey,

I also want to welcome everybody who has recently subscribed to the
openrecord-dev mailing list.

It's been a couple months since I last sent out a welcome message, and 
in that time another 10 or 20 people have signed up.  There are now 
about 40 of us subscribed:
   http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/roster/openrecord-dev

Feel free to ask lots of questions on the mailing list.  We don't yet
have much documentation about OpenRecord, so this is the best place for
learning more about OpenRecord.  Or you can send questions directly to
me, if you prefer not to have them archived on the mailing list.

Cheers,

Subject: [openrecord-dev] Hans Roslings talk -- animated scatter plots and time-series data
Message-ID: <44B49CF7.2030709@dojotoolkit.org>

Here's a great talk by Hans Roslings, from the 2006 TED conference, if 
you've got Flash installed, and a broadband connection:
   http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=hans_rosling

Hans Rosling is a public health expert, and the talk is nominally about 
global development, but the talk also serves a great example of what can 
be done with the visual display of quantitative information.  In 
particular, Rosling makes a lot of use of bubble plots, which is 
especially topical for OpenRecord, since Hiran is working this week on a 
scatter-plot/bubble-plot plugin for OpenRecord.

The whole talk is about 20 minutes long.  Watching just the first 5 
minutes, that's enough to see some of the cool plots.  If you watch the 
whole thing, in the last 5 or 6 minutes he talks about data 
visualization software, and accessing database over the Internet.

Rosling shows a bunch of plots that are animated, displaying 40 years of 
time-series data in a 30-second animation.  We've talked about having 
animated views in OpenRecord too, and there's no reason we can't do that 
(just a small matter of programming).

Rosling's talk is also a nice reminder about the importance of time 
series data.  The current OpenRecord data model doesn't have any sort of 
intrinsic support for time-series data, nor does the experimental 
dojo.data code that I wrote earlier this year, nor does the data model 
code that IBM is contributing to dojo.  It would be cool to have time as 
a first-class notion in the data model, but maybe that's too ambitious. 
  I'm known for undertaking efforts that are too ambitious!

One last cool thing -- Rosling's talk is released under a Creative 
Commons license.  I'm psyched to see the CC licenses becoming more and 
more common.

check out this really cool open source javascript timeline widget:

http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/

It uses a simple XML format as input so it seems like it could be
integrated in openrecord relatively easily (and its part of the Simile
RDF project at MIT, so hopefully they're thinking about how to
represent time series in RDF)

While I'm at it, I recently stumbled across some open source pivot
table and OLAP apps. If OpenRecord ever takes on Wikipedia size data
sets (e.g. a WikiAlmanac) it will probably have to go down the OLAP
route, so it's nice to know there are some serious open source options
out there.

http://jpivot.sourceforge.net/index.html

its made by
http://www.jasperreports.com/
which is trying to to be an open source OLAP/Business Intelligence vendor.

(see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_BI )

And here's another open source web app that uses jpivot to navigate data cubes:

Hi Hiran,

I'm cc'ing this message to the openrecord-dev mailing list because I 
think it might be interesting to other people (like Adam and Mignon) and 
I'm hoping to get their suggestions about different approaches.

If you decide to work on the Pivot Table next, I have some old 
JavaScript Pivot Table code that might be useful to you.  Here's the 
demo page, with two example tables:
  http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/test_page.html

And here are the source code files:
  http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/pivot_table.js
  http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/data_vortex.js
  http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/

I wrote that code back in 2004 when I was first learning JavaScript, 
before I knew about Dojo, and before we started the OpenRecord project. 
  The code is old is clumsy, but it does work, so it might be useful to 
you.

For the Pivot Table, I think the biggest problem will be figuring out 
how to take the data structures of Items and Attributes and transform 
that data into something that makes sense to display in a Pivot Table. 
The first problem isn't so much a programming problem as a conceptual 
problem, or perhaps a UI design problem...

Pivot Tables work best when there are a small number of axes that can be 
pivoted (maybe 2 to 6), and where each axis has a small number of 
possible buckets (maybe 2 to 20).  On my demo page there are two example 
tables: "Gas Tax Accounting" and "Population":
   * The Population table has 4 axes: Gender (male/female/both), 
Rural/Urban, Country (India/China/All), and Year (1948/1949).  Each axis 
has only 2 or 3 possible buckets -- for example, Country has "Rural", 
"Urban", and "Both".
   * The Gas Tax table has only 3 axes: Year, Charity, and 
Form-of-donation.  The Year axes has 3 buckets (2001, 2002, 2003), the 
Form axes has 4 buckets (Cash, Stock, Goods, Services), and the Charity 
axis has 9 buckets.  So the Gas Tax table has a total of 108 data cells 
(3 * 4 * 9).

In OpenRecord, Items have Attributes with values, and those values can 
be strings, dates, numbers, or references to other items.  It seems to 
me that there might be more than one approach for mapping the ideas of 
Items/Attributes/values to the ideas of Axes/Buckets/cells...

Here's one approach... To display a Pivot Table with 3 axes and 108 
cells, you might populate the table from a set of 108 OpenRecord Items. 
  So, for a table like the Gas Tax table, you might have 108 Items all 
in the Category "Donation", where each Donation Item has a 3 attributes 
called "Year", "Form", and "Charity", plus an additional attribute 
called "Amount".  An individual Donation Item might look like this:
   Category: Donation
   Year:     2001
   Form:     Cash
   Charity:  Greenbelt Alliance
   Amount:   $61.46

That first approach will only work well if the number of Donation Items 
is the same as the number of cells in the Pivot Table.

A better approach might be to allow for there to be many more Donation 
Items, and then have the Pivot Table automatically calculate the totals. 
  So in this second approach, there could be 5 different Donation Items 
that are all donations of Cash in 2001 to the Greenbelt Alliance, and 
the Pivot Table will add all 5 of the Amount values and show that total 
in the corresponding cell of the Pivot Table.

That second approach will work smoothly if all of the Items in the 
category Donation all have values for the 4 Attributes Year, Form, 
Charity, and Amount.  I'm not sure what the Pivot Table code should do 
if some of the Items are missing some Attributes, or if some of the 
Items have Amount values that are not Numbers, or if one of the Items 
has a multi-valued Amount Attribute.  This second approach also only 
works well if the values that the user wants to see in the cell are 
things that can be totaled up, like numbers.  In some other scenarios, 
the user might not want to see the sum of a set of Attribute values, but 
might instead want to see an average of the values, or see a count of 
the number of Items that fall into that cell.

Maybe you can think up good solutions to some of those problems.  I'll 
keep thinking about it too, and I'll let you know if I have new ideas. 
Also, maybe other people on the openrecord-dev mailing list will be able 
to propose solutions.

Hi Hiran,

If you decide to work on the OpenRecord Gantt Chart plugin next, you 
should look into using the Timeline widget from the SIMILE project. 
Adam Souzis just posted a message about it to the openrecord-dev list 
yesterday -- I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it yet.

Here are a few demo pages...

Try dragging left and right, and clicking on the dots and bars:
  http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/

Check out the text-highlighting feature, by typing in one of the colored 
text-boxes:
  http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/examples/religions/religions.html

And here's one that has 4 bands to scroll time at 4 different time-scales:
  http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/examples/dinosaurs/dinosaurs2.html

Also available in both vertical and horizontal:
  http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/basics.html

And it seems be extremely well documented:
  http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/

The code is available under a BSD license, so we can safely include that 
code in our own SVN repository as long as we're careful to preserve and 
include the original copyright and license statements.

The Timeline widget can be populated with data in JSON format, so it 
should be fairly easy to feed it data from OpenRecord.  Realistically, I 
imagine that there'll be a ton of little issues involved in actually 
getting the Timeline wired up to work within OpenRecord, but the work 
involved in resolving those issues is probably a small fraction of what 
it would take to do a good Gantt Chart from scratch.  There's also some 
overlap/duplication where both the Timeline widget and Dojo each have 
their own way of doing something (localization, for example), but that's 
okay.

Hello Brian,

I thought of writing the pivot chart first since a heavy research part is
not involved in it.

Thanks for the explanation and I did an analysis based on it.

I agree. I think a drop down should be provided for the user to select chart
attributes. It is better to have an upper bound for the number of axes(E.g.:
6). But there could be attributes which are not suitable for the pivot table
( E.g.: Attributes with a unique value). The plugin can either exclude such
attributes from the drop down or display a warning that the table may be too
big to display if that attribute is selected. In order to determine suitable
attributes, I thought of comparing the item count with distinct attribute
value count and decide based on a standard (E.g.: If the item count is 50
and the an attribute has 15 distinct values, the attribute is a suitable
attribute for the chart). There could also be an upper bound for the number
of buckets (E.g.: 20).

Please tell me what you think about it.

I thought of going for the second approach, which is complete and user
friendly. For missing information, some logic can be used to compare the
attributes values and if all nonempty attribute values are matched, the
missing information can be predicted. But if the value that appears in the
cells (additional attribute) is missing, the item can be ignored. Handling
multiple items with same data needs to be figured out. The plugin can
provide a drop down list specifying the treatment of the multiple items. For
example, the drop down can have options for numeric addition, average
calculation, and string addition. But this approach would not be effective
if the user wants average for one axis and addition for another. I'll let
you know if I find a more effective method to do this.

Again, I need your opinion.

Cheers,
Hiran

That sounds like a good approach.

Okay, sounds good.

I don't think I understand that idea.  It sounds like a feature that you 
would add once other things are already working, so maybe we don't need 
to discuss it yet, but when the time comes maybe you can tell me more 
about the idea or give an example.

I like your idea of using a drop down to let the user pick different 
ways of combining values (numeric addition, average, string 
concatenation).  You could have just one drop down for the whole pivot 
table, so that the user could not pick "average" for one axis and 
"addition" for another.

AFAIK gapminder's components are not open source -- how were you thinking of
reusing it?

Hi Saurabh,

Thanks for the pointer, I hadn't realized there was demo posted that you 
can actually play with.  That's a very cool visualization tool.  I 
wonder why that demo is posted at a tools.google.com address instead of 
www.gapminder.org?

There is one Dojo package, dojo.storage, that does make use of flash. 
The dojo.storage package doesn't actually use any of the UI features of 
flash, but instead uses a feature that can save data to a cache on the 
user's local hard drive, and dojo.storage makes that feature available 
to dojo apps through a JavaScript API.

I don't know much about flash, or about how flash and JavaScript talk to 
each other.  It would be cool if we could use the gapminder component in 
JavaScript.  It would also be possible for someone to write a similar 
widget in pure JavaScript, given a year or two to work on it!

Welcome to the list.  Did the company that you were at end up shipping 
that product?  I'm always interested in learning about similar tools.

I'm not sure what happened to the original message.  There seems to have 
been some mailer glitch that I'm at a loss to explain.  Saurabh's 
original post to the openrecord-dev list did get through Mignon via her 
subscription to the list (which is how I found out about it), but for 
some reason the message did not make it to my in-box, and did not get 
archived on the openrecord-dev archive site:
  https://bat.berlios.de/pipermail/openrecord-dev/2006-July/date.html

I have no idea whether the original message made it to everybody else or 
not.  I'm not that knowledgeable about mail servers and mailing list 
software, so I'm clueless about what went wrong or how to fix it.

Maybe there was some problem because the message wasn't just plain text, 
but was multipart MIME with an HTML part?  Anybody have any ideas? 
Anyway, sorry about the buggy infrastructure.  We're going to be moving 
all of the openrecord infrastructure over onto dojo servers pretty soon 
anyway, so we'll be set up with brand new mailing lists, bug tracking, 
SVN repository, and MediaWiki wiki.

The Gapminder website emphasizes that Gapminder is a non-profit and 
describes their software as "free software" that they encourage you to 
download and distribute.  But I can't find anything on the site about 
open source licensing.

Seems possible that the Gapminder software actually is open source and 
they're just failing to advertise that, or maybe it's not open source 
yet but they might be willing to open source it if somebody asked.

In any case, it's probably moot for OpenRecord, unless there's a good 
way for the OpenRecord plugin loader to load flash plugins and pass data 
to them just like JavaScript plugins.  I don't know anything about 
whether that's possible.

This is possible to do in a few ways, unless they designed their flash apps
in a particularly obtuse way. Javascript communication with flash objects
has been possible for years, but its improved in Flash 9.

The dojo.flash infrastructure should help with some of the problem, 
insofar as it allows high-speed data passing between plugin and JS 
contexts across Flash versions and allows you to write the Flash side 
in pure ActionScript (thanks MTASC!), but it certainly would require 
work to do things like that.

It might just be worth waiting for dojo.gfx to mature a bit.
