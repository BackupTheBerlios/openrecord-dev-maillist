Hey Alex,

I'm not on the ng-dhtml list, so I'm sending this to you instead (and cc'ing
it to the openrecord-dev list).  Feel free to forward this mail to ng-dhtml,
and to add me to the ng-dhtml list if that's appropriate.

Subject: [openrecord-dev] public domain dedication combined with open source license?
Message-ID: <200511042242.jA4MgBN25292@bat.berlios.de>

Hey Joi,

I'm very glad I got a chance to speak with you at the Creative Commons
fundraiser last night.  Thanks for offering to put me in touch with people
at OSI who can help me.

Here's the 2-minute summary of the problem I'm trying to solve.  Feel free
to forward this to other people...

I've started a small open source software project, openrecord.org, with a
few volunteer programmers.  We want to distribute our work with no
restrictions, so that anyone can take all of it, or any small part of it,
and use it for any purpose.  

We've been making the work available using the Creative Commons Public
Domain Dedication (CC-PDD), but unfortunately the CC-PDD only addresses
copyright issues, not patent rights.  We plan to also start making the work
available under the Academic Free License (AFL), which addresses patent
rights and is OSI certified.  

I have never seen a project release code under a dual-license using a
conventional open source license in combination with a public domain
dedication.  So I'm looking for some advice...  Can we do this?  Are we on
solid legal footing?  Is there some simpler alternative?  What language
should we use in the "copyright" statement in our files?

The AFL, like other open source licenses, carries a perpetual attribution
requirement.  If I understand correctly, all derivative works and remixes,
and derivatives of those derivates, forever after, will have to carry the
original copyright notice and an AFL attribution notice.  If all open source
projects used the same license, or if open source projects never borrowed
code from one another, then the attribution notice might not be a big deal.
In practice, I think the attribution requirement is a significant barrier to
free remixing of code.  If someone wants to take 20 lines of code from one
project and mix that in with code from a dozen other projects licensed under
a dozen other licenses, it's simply too much trouble to try to keep track of
exactly which lines of code need to be attributed to whom.  I'd like to
solve that problem.  I'd like to make our code freely available, with no
burden of attribution, and with clear, comprehensive grants of both patent
and copyright rights.  Is a CC-PDD/AFL dual-license a good way to try do
that?

Thanks for your help.

Cheers,
  Brian Skinner

Yes, three cheers and a big thank you to Brian for making this happen  
- very cool!

I spoke to Alex Russell at SuperHappyDevHouse yesterday, and if  
understood him correctly he'd like us to be on the commits list on  
the dojo project itself, and also as voters for the foundation. That  
sounded really cool too.

Turns out Socialtext just hired Ken Pier, who was the principal engineer of
Sparrow Web at (Xerox) PARC.  I still haven't played with Sparrow Web, but I
read through some of the documentation last week.  Seems like Sparrow Web
must have been years ahead of its time, back when it first got written, in
the mid-1990s.

Chao and I went to Socialtext's "Wiki Wednesday" gathering last week, and
Ken Pier was there.  I got a chance to ask him questions about Sparrow Web,
and he sat in on the demo of OpenRecord I gave.  I'm hoping I'll be able to
talk with him more -- he probably has years and years of real world
experience about what features users actually do and don't need in a tool
like Sparrow Web or OpenRecord.

Subject: [openrecord-dev] Ning, Dabble, Google Base, etc.
Message-ID: <4381008C.6020303@gumption.org>

I added links from the OpenRecord website to some projects that have 
similar features:
  http://openrecord.org/bookmarks.html#similar

The new links include pointers to:
   Google Base
   The Ning Content Store
   Dabble DB
   Dan Bricklan's wikiCalc
   Sproutliner
   Sparrow Web
   MediaWiki projects: Wikidata and the Semantic MediaWiki project
   Daisy CMS
   Intuit QuickBase
   Semantic wiki projects: Platypus, Rhizome, Gnowsis, etc.

Here are some notes about a few of the projects...

--------------------------------------------------
Google Base

Google Base has a data model that's vaguely similar to the OpenRecord 
data model. For example, in Google Base any item can have any number of 
ad-hoc attributes, any attribute can be multi-valued, any date value can 
have an end-date as well as a start-date, and numbers can have units 
(like "meters" or "meters/second").

However, I think the similarities end there. Google Base seems to be 
oriented toward "monolithic" items, rather than big structures of small 
items -- for example Google Base does not seem to be designed to support 
any type of references between items, or multi-item transactions.

--------------------------------------------------
The Ning Content Store

On the Ning web site there's a nice one-page description of their "Ning 
Content Store":
   http://developerdocumentation.ning.com/post.php?Post:slug=ContentStore

Ning uses a custom Content Store that has a data model which is similar 
in many ways to the OpenRecord data model.

A Ning "Content Object" is like an OpenRecord "Item". The most 
significant similarity is that both Ning and OpenRecord lack any notion 
of pre-defined schema -- any items (content objects) can have any 
attributes. Ning and OpenRecord are also similar in that they both 
support bi-directional references.

However, there are a number of differences. In Ning, each Object can be 
of only one type, and the type of an Object cannot change once the 
Object is created -- OpenRecord has no similar notion. In Ning, an 
attribute is identified by its name (a string) -- in OpenRecord 
attributes are identified by UUID, an attribute can have different names 
in different languages, and each attribute is itself an item, so it can 
have not only a 'name', but also a 'summary' description, and other 
descriptive attributes. Like OpenRecord, Ning allows any attribute to be 
multi-valued, but in Ning all the values of a multi-valued attribute 
must be of the same type. Ning has a notion of public vs. private 
content, whereas OpenRecord treats all content as public. OpenRecord 
includes some support for transactions, whereas Ning generally doesn't.

--------------------------------------------------
Dabble DB

The Dabble web site currently only has a few screenshots, and doesn't 
have much written documentation. So, it's hard to know quite what Dabble 
is, but judging by what is posted it certainly looks like Dabble and 
OpenRecord are both trying to solve the same problems. Their weblog has 
some appealing posts talking about usability and the relationship 
between spreadsheets and databases:
