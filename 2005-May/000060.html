<PRE>|<i> &gt; If you press the &quot;Edit&quot; button, then you see 
</I>|<i> &gt; bordered &quot;edit boxes&quot; whenever you hover the 
</I>|<i> &gt; mouse over the text fields.  Our current code 
</I>|<i> &gt; doesn't give visual cues until you actually 
</I>|<i> &gt; click on the text.  Is that something we
</I>|<i> &gt; should fix before 0.1?
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> You're right, the mouseover behavior has changed with 
</I>|<i> the hovering.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> I would prefer to have a UI design and CSS architecture 
</I>|<i> melding before fixing it, as I see this as part of getting 
</I>|<i> CSS done right?  
</I>
Okay, let's wait on that fix until we've done more UI design and re-thought
the CSS architecture.


|<i> I'm much more fixated on the shrinking and expanding 
</I>|<i> textedit box, 'tho :(, as that's just plain wrong 
</I>|<i> regardless of what UI design we choose.
</I>
Yup, the shrinking and expanding is just plain wrong.  But I'm reluctant to
fix that right now...  

We still haven't thought much about what sort of UI components we want to
have within each table cell.  I think in the long run we're going to want to
have a UI that lets people add more than one entry into a table cell, and a
UI for selecting entries, deleting entries, reordering entries, etc.  Also a
UI for doing data type validation, and a UI for auto completion as you're
typing.  And a UI for entering references to other items by selecting them
from pull-down lists, or via drag-and-drop.  

All of which means that code for what's going on within a table cell is
likely to change a great deal in next few months, so it might not be worth
spending much time debugging the visual glitch in the current code.
