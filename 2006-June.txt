That would be great!

Yes, OpenRecord does have its own mailing list:
   http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openrecord-dev

More info here:

Like the rest of the Dojo code, the OpenRecord code isn't well 
documented yet.  Using the PHP scripts as a reference is a good idea -- 
the PHP scripts actually do very little of the work, so I imagine you'll 
be able to easily replicate them Java, and from there you can start 
making improvements.  It would be great to do a re-write with more of an 
eye towards security -- potential security holes are one of the things 
that's been keeping us from posting an up to date demo.

Here's an old post to the openrecord-dev list that talks about how we 
currently do client/server communication.  You might find it useful.  It 
also talks about some proposed backing store alternatives which we were 
considering at the time.  Now we're leaning more towards using an RDF 
datastore, but we haven't yet started working on that, so our options 
are still open:

Subject: [openrecord-dev] IBM + Dojo partnership announcement
Message-ID: <4484E333.9030801@dojotoolkit.org>

Good news...

IBM made a very positive announcement today about how they are using and 
contributing to the Dojo Toolkit.  As Alex Russell put it, "Today, IBM 
has acknowledged the Dojo Foundation as the place where 
professional-level JavaScript work gets done."

Here are a couple links:
  http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=133309
  http://dojotoolkit.org/pipermail/dojo-contributors/2006-June/002321.html

This is great for Dojo, and for OpenRecord.  IBM has already started 
contributing significant amounts of code to Dojo, and in the months to 
come IBM plans to donate a body of data model work that reflects many 
engineer-years of real world experience.

Once Dojo has a standard data model, then in time we should begin to see 
data model bindings for many of the Dojo widgets.  And hopefully we'll 
also see a set of data providers for populating the Dojo data model with 
data from different data sources, like SQL databases and XML datastores. 
  Which means that eventually OpenRecord may be a fairly thin layer of 
code that takes advantage of a bunch of heavily-used, well-tested Dojo 
infrastructure.

More good news...

Google is releasing a web-based Spreadsheet tool.

Not much info available yet, but Google says that "Multiple people can 
edit or view your spreadsheet at the same time".  More info here:

Also, Dan Bricklin, inventor of the spreadsheet, has a AJAX-y
spreadsheet wiki tool and he's released a new version a couple of
months ago:

I haven't compared the two yet but one obvious advantage over google's
tool is that it is open source while google's is a proprietary
service.

Avi and Andrew, the Dabble DB guys, have a blog that I like a lot. 
Their post today talks about how the Google Spreadsheets product 
compares to Dabble DB, and why Dabble DB might be a better tool for some 
common use cases.  Dabble and OpenRecord seem to have very similar 
design goals, so I think a lot of this is topical for OpenRecord too:
