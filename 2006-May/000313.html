<PRE>Hi Brian,

it's a pleasure to find a project doing all the work, which was in my 
dreams agenda :-)
I'm happy that my suggestions find resonance.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 401. How do you create a new page?
 &gt;&gt;&gt;    - current solution: &quot;New Page&quot; button
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Select &quot;toolbar add&quot; and chose page-title.
 &gt;
 &gt; Right, I think introducing a toolbar may be a good idea.  We would 
have to think about what other controls it would make sense to have on 
the toolbar.  If we do have a toolbar, maybe we can just have two 
buttons for add-page and add-section, so that adding is a one-click 
action, rather than having to click a generic add button to enter an add 
mode, and then also select an object.  We've been talking about trying 
to avoid having modes and modal interfaces, if possible.

In my opinion it is better to have less but powerfull tools in the toolbox.
You always have the design-option to expand multi-level selections to a 
broader range of selections but you loose focus doing that. A mix of 
these design-patterns are the &quot;auto-hiding&quot; menues of current ms 
software. The same way the &quot;add-tool&quot; could be expanded or accompanied 
by the most common choices. It could be a user preference option wether 
to show them allways or only if the &quot;main action button&quot; is selected.  
If the UI supports the  user by showing options in places they are 
appropriate , a kind of modal interface is nice in my opinion. You can 
think of the &quot;add-icon&quot; as &quot;show add-controls icon&quot;, making it not modal 
(if modal means: there is a state of the application the user has to 
keep in mind, since it is not visible to him).
You can see this design-pattern working in older text/graphical adventures.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 202. How do you change the order of the sections on a page?
 &gt;&gt;&gt;    - grab the section and drag it up or down
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; aditionaly: Have attributes for the sections. Allow page to choose on
 &gt;&gt; which attribute the section-display should  be sorted.
 &gt;
 &gt; Do you have an example in mind, where this would be useful?  My first 
reaction is that most users wouldn't need that feature.  Seems like it's 
probably enough to just let users explicitly re-order the sections, 
without needing to do automatic sorting.

This depends on what &quot;section&quot; means. If for example on a page about a 
person you add sections about his children, you can order them by name, 
birth date, location etc.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 203. How do you delete/retire a section?
 &gt;&gt;&gt;    - select the section by...
 &gt;&gt; Have a trashicon in the toolbar.
 &gt;&gt; a) drag the section into the trash
 &gt;&gt; b) select trash and then select section
 &gt;
 &gt; Option (a) sounds good to me.  I don't like option (b) so much, 
because it's a modal UI.  We had talking about having a trashcan, but we 
got stuck because we weren't sure where on the page to put it.  If we 
have a toolbar then that does seem like a natural place.

This is the same topic as the &quot;add-icon&quot; question. Thinking b) as &quot;show 
delete action-buttons&quot; makes it not modal.

 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; 204. How do you select a section?
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; by double clicking its title. what to do if there is no title ?
 &gt;
 &gt; We have it set up now so that if you click on the title text, that 
selects the text and you can edit it.  If you double click somewhere on 
the title, that selects the word you clicked on, just like it would in a 
word processor or an e-mail client.  I think we should keep double-click 
for that use.  It'd be good if we could find some other way to select 
the section as a whole.

Add a &quot;select action&quot;, like the pointer in any vector-drawing application.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 206. Can you move a section from one page to another?
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Can you include a section from one page into an other ?
 &gt;
 &gt; Nope, right now a section can only appear on a single page.
 &gt;
I would like to think about a section as also beeing a page. Having a 
section in a page might expand to having a special view of a page inside 
another page.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Categories
 &gt;&gt;&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 &gt;&gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Allow hierarchical categories ?
 &gt;
 &gt; That's not something we allow for now, but I can see where that would 
be useful.

Having hierarchical categories is (IMO) crucial for collecting bigger 
amounts of data.
Think about organizing your books / bibliographic data. You want to be 
able to do a querry about all of the data, but also about special kinds.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 301. If you create a new section, and create an item in the section,
 &gt;&gt;&gt; what category is the item in?
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; A default category for the object type being edited.
 &gt;
 &gt; Can you explain a little more, or give an example?  I don't 
understand what you mean by &quot;the object type being edited&quot;.

I'm perceive categories as object hierarchies, giving new pages 
(objects) attribute-sets and also default values for attributs.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 302. How do you create a new category?
 &gt;&gt;&gt;    - current solution: create a new Section, and in the query 
editor for
 &gt;&gt;&gt; the section, type in a new category name
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Having hierarchical categories:
 &gt;&gt; - allow to add to the &quot;childrens list&quot; of categories for one category.
 &gt;&gt; - allow to add to the &quot;parents list&quot; of categories for one category.
 &gt;
 &gt; So we add somewhere new in the UI where you can browse the existing 
hierarchy of categories, and that's where you add new categories?

Yes.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 402. How do you delete/retire a page?
 &gt;&gt;&gt;    - right click on the nav bar menu item for the page, and select
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Retire Page&quot;
 &gt;&gt;&gt;    - navigate to the page, click the &quot;Show Tools&quot; button, and then the
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Retire Page&quot; button
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; - drag the title  to the trashicon in the toolbar.
 &gt;&gt; - drag the trashicon on the title
 &gt;&gt; - select trash , then select title
 &gt;
 &gt; If the user starts dragging somewhere on the title, I think that 
should select a region of text, just like it does in a word processor or 
an e-mail client.  So I don't think there's a good way to let the user 
drag the title to the trashcan.  Dragging the trashcan to the title 
doesn't seem intuitive to me.  I'm not familiar with any other program 
where you drag the trashcan around in order to throw things in the 
trash.  It seems like we need a way to select the page as a whole, and 
then drag the page to the trashcan.

Add an &quot;select tool&quot; to the toolbar.
If there are many choices for a region in a page for selections this 
button would show  appropriate controls in these places.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 706. Can you select the text within an entry and change it?
 &gt;&gt;&gt;    - yes, for any type of entry
 &gt;&gt;&gt;    - not in item-reference lozenges
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; for item-references the text should be editable, but the widget to
 &gt;&gt; edit it should be aware of object-queries, allowing kinds of
 &gt;&gt; autocompletion / hierarchical browsing ...
 &gt;
 &gt; Okay, so if when you select the text within an item-reference entry 
and change the text from &quot;Boston&quot; to &quot;Berlin&quot; (with autocompletion), 
then that changes the entry to point to the Berlin item, rather than 
simply renaming the Boston item?

Yes. Different kinds of attributes could be accompanied by different 
controls.
Choosing places could be supported by a hierarchical geographical browser,
limiting the available autocompletion options to something the user can 
quickly select from.

In general I find multi-hierarchies (t.m. an object can have multiple 
parents) the best solution to help selecting along big amounts of data.
