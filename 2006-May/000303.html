<PRE>Brian and I have been talking about re-architecting OpenRecord and I
thought I'd try to summarize this for the list.

At the face-to-face meeting Brian said that one of the things
OpenRecord is &quot;is a usable product in Jan 2007&quot;.

To accomplish this OpenRecord needs to major changes, most important
of which is that it needs to talk to a server. Also another goal of
OpenRecord is to create data that doesn't &quot;bitrot&quot;. At the very least,
this requires using a standard data format. So the idea now is to use
RDF instead OR's home-grown data model.

Brian proposed the following steps for re-architecting:

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   1. invent a data model (or meta-model) for dojo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   2. throw together some experimental dojo.data code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   3. get feedback about the design on the dojo dev list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   4. iterate on 2 and 3, improving the data handling layer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   5. merge our dojo.data layer with IBM's contribution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   6. make a couple bindings that talk to data stores
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;       - a binding to Raccoon, or some RDF store
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;       - simple bindings for CSV, file system files, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   7. make bindings to dojo widgets, or invite other dojo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      contributors to do that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;       - table widget
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;       - chart widget
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;       - tree widget
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   8. port OpenRecord UI over to dojo.data model, thereby
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;       making OpenRecord be able to talk to server-side
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;       data stores
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   (6, 7, and 8 can happen in parallel, once 1-5 are done)
</I>
However, IMHO this will still take too long to meet the Jan 2007 goal.

So here's a straw man proposal:

Currently OR has several layers including: Views (with a plugin api),
Data (the data model), and Storage.  Forget about them all (for now).

Instead just focus on extending the Dojo table control to be fully
editable: adding columns and rows, in-editing of cells, basic data
validation, undo/redo, change notifications, etc.

On thing this doesn't require is a binding to some data model (like
the one IBM is contributing to Dojo). Instead it just has the
appropriate hooks where something like that can be implemented in the
future. And instead of being depending on the data model, OR can for
now implement those hooks with a simple api for reading and writing
RDF with some back-end (e.g. Raccoon).

But if we're ignoring the View layer what about all the other layout
elements? Answer: Layout is not stored as part of the data model. The
code for adding sections, building queries, etc. would just be like
any other Dojo app -- i.e. manipulate the DOM. The layout can then be
saved like any other HTML page.

Finally there's a lot of nuts &amp; bolts functionality: versioning &amp;
history, user authentication &amp; authorization, conflict detection and
consistency validation, etc.   These should be handled by the
back-end/host application (again, e.g. Raccoon).

The benefits of this approach:

* the core widgets would be broadly reusable and so hopefully will
attract outside support by other Dojo users
* this architecture is emenable to using OR as a plugin in other
wikis, and so hopefully will attract outside support.
* much less dependencies on outside tasks
* overall a less complex system
* most importantly, if we're focused, i believe we could actually ship
something usable in 7 months.

thoughts?

cheers,
adam
