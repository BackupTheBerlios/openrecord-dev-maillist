<PRE>&gt;<i> 101. Autosave vs. undo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now we have no &quot;Save&quot; button, and all changes are instantly saved.
</I>&gt;<i> But that means adding an &quot;Undo&quot; feature is prohibitively difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> But maybe we could have some sort of  revert/rollback feature that feels
</I>&gt;<i> lightweight enough to be like an Undo feature. Alternatively, we could
</I>&gt;<i> have an &quot;Undo&quot; feature, and replace the current autosave behavior with
</I>&gt;<i> an explicit &quot;Save&quot; button.  Which way is better, or is there some other
</I>&gt;<i> hybrid solution?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Show a &quot;history&quot;-button while editing. If the user clicks on it show a
summary about changes to choose an old state of the object /
attribute. Like the history in photoshop.

&gt;<i> 103. Delete vs. retire
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you delete an item, it's never really gone.  You can always see it
</I>&gt;<i> again by going to its URL, or by looking at an old version of a page
</I>&gt;<i> that used to show it.  Should we use the term &quot;retire&quot; instead of &quot;delete&quot;?
</I>
One could mark the deleted object as beeing in the trashcan while
showing the old revision.


&gt;<i> 104. Edit mode vs. view mode
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you try to start editing a page, but you're not able to edit because
</I>&gt;<i> you haven't logged in yet, how do we help you figure out that you need
</I>&gt;<i> to log in?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Allow edit ever. Insert a message into the page alerting the user that
saving is active until he logs in.

&gt;<i> 105. Show Tools
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can we get rid of the &quot;Show Tools&quot; button, and instead be in &quot;Show
</I>&gt;<i> Tools&quot; mode all the time.  How do we do that without cluttering the page
</I>&gt;<i> with stuff like the &quot;New Page&quot; and &quot;New Section&quot; buttons?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Add a toolbar with one &quot;add new&quot;-button. Choosing this and selecting
any object a new object of this type can be added.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 107. Date/time annotations for Entries
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
One possibility is to allow to edit the time-ranges in the history.

&gt;<i> 108. Annotations for Entries
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can each Entry have other associated annotations?
</I>&gt;<i>   - Units for numbers, like {45 mph}
</I>&gt;<i>   - Language specifiers for strings, like {&quot;Germany&quot; lang=en} or
</I>&gt;<i> {&quot;Deutchland&quot; lang=de}
</I>&gt;<i>   - Citations or annotations, like {284 cite=&quot;CIA World Factbook, page 84&quot;}
</I>&gt;<i>   - Timespans, like {&quot;Leslie Lynch King, Jr.&quot; from=1913-1915}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How much work is it to have all the UI views deal with all this?
</I>
Missing annotations like &quot;who changed which attribute for what reason&quot;
 to feed the history.
Units for numbers seems to be a different topic: this should be part
of the attribute type (for the example: velocity), allowing automatic
translation into different units.

&gt;<i> 201. How do you create a new section on a page?
</I>&gt;<i>    - current solution: &quot;New Section&quot; button
</I>
Have a toolbar with actions to perform on existing objects.
User selects &quot;add&quot;.
a) User selects an object.
UI shows options about which object can be created for this object.
b) User selects no object for some time:
Decorate the objects, for which somethig can be added.

&gt;<i> 202. How do you change the order of the sections on a page?
</I>&gt;<i>    - grab the section and drag it up or down
</I>aditionaly: Have attributes for the sections. Allow page to choose on
which attribute the section-display should  be sorted.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 203. How do you delete/retire a section?
</I>&gt;<i>    - select the section by...
</I>Have a trashicon in the toolbar.
a) drag the section into the trash
b) select trash and then select section

&gt;<i> 204. How do you select a section?
</I>
by double clicking its title. what to do if there is no title ?

&gt;<i> 206. Can you move a section from one page to another?
</I>
Can you include a section from one page into an other ?


&gt;<i> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</I>&gt;<i> Categories
</I>&gt;<i> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Allow hierarchical categories ?

&gt;<i> 301. If you create a new section, and create an item in the section,
</I>&gt;<i> what category is the item in?
</I>
A default category for the object type being edited.

&gt;<i> 302. How do you create a new category?
</I>&gt;<i>    - current solution: create a new Section, and in the query editor for
</I>&gt;<i> the section, type in a new category name
</I>
Having hierarchical categories:
- allow to add to the &quot;childrens list&quot; of categories for one category.
- allow to add to the &quot;parents list&quot; of categories for one category.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 401. How do you create a new page?
</I>&gt;<i>    - current solution: &quot;New Page&quot; button
</I>
Select &quot;toolbar add&quot; and chose page-title.

&gt;<i> 402. How do you delete/retire a page?
</I>&gt;<i>    - right click on the nav bar menu item for the page, and select
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Retire Page&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    - navigate to the page, click the &quot;Show Tools&quot; button, and then the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Retire Page&quot; button
</I>
- drag the title  to the trashicon in the toolbar.
- drag the trashicon on the title
- select trash , then select title


&gt;<i> 403. How do you see a list of the deleted/retired pages?
</I>
Open the trashbin and search there.


&gt;<i> 701. Input validation -- In table view or detail view, if the expected
</I>&gt;<i> type of an attribute is Number (or Date), and you enter &quot;Clinton&quot;, do we
</I>&gt;<i> offer any UI feedback about the type mis-match?
</I>&gt;<i>    - current solution: no feedback, or very subtle font color differences
</I>&gt;<i>    - red underline, like mis-spelled words in a word processor
</I>&gt;<i>    - little red dot next to the entry
</I>
Have also a view &quot;things to fix&quot;.

&gt;<i> 702. When a cell in a table includes two entries, how do they appear?
</I>&gt;<i>    - current solution: both on one line, separated by a gray dot
</I>&gt;<i>    - on two lines within the same cell
</I>If there is a filter: display only matching entries.

&gt;<i> 703. How do you add a second entry to a cell in a table?
</I>&gt;<i>    - select an existing entry and then press Alt-Enter on the keyboard
</I>&gt;<i>    - click on the &quot;+&quot; icon within the cell
</I>&gt;<i>    - right click in the cell for a context menu, and select &quot;Add entry&quot;
</I>If there is an overall toolbar: select &quot;add&quot; and then select the cell.


&gt;<i> 706. Can you select the text within an entry and change it?
</I>&gt;<i>    - yes, for any type of entry
</I>&gt;<i>    - not in item-reference lozenges
</I>for item-references the text should be editable, but the widget to
edit it should be aware of object-queries, allowing kinds of
autocompletion / hierarchical browsing ...

~~~~~

Quite a lot of the suggestions rely on having a toolbar. Sorry, when I
missed a design desision not to have such modal input. In my opinion
its usefull to have &quot;a box of tools in one location&quot; to apply on
different objects shown on a page.
As I understood the UI should help the user to be aware of available
actions on objects (add new section, add new page). If any of these
options are shown, the page is full of buttons for all kind of
objects, which can be acted upon.
If there is a toolbar. the user can select the action first. The UI
can help him, if for some time he does not choose an object to act
upon.
Available actions on objects could also be highlighted in the toolbox
/ bar  while hovering around the page.
