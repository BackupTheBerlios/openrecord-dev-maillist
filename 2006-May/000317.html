</I>
Thanks!

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; 401. How do you create a new page?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;    - current solution: &quot;New Page&quot; button
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Select &quot;toolbar add&quot; and chose page-title.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right, I think introducing a toolbar may be a good idea...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion it is better to have less but powerfull tools in the toolbox.
</I>&gt;<i> You always have the design-option to expand multi-level selections to a 
</I>&gt;<i> broader range of selections but you loose focus doing that. A mix of 
</I>&gt;<i> these design-patterns are the &quot;auto-hiding&quot; menues of current ms 
</I>&gt;<i> software. The same way the &quot;add-tool&quot; could be expanded or accompanied 
</I>&gt;<i> by the most common choices. It could be a user preference option wether 
</I>&gt;<i> to show them allways or only if the &quot;main action button&quot; is selected.  
</I>&gt;<i> If the UI supports the  user by showing options in places they are 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate , a kind of modal interface is nice in my opinion. You can 
</I>&gt;<i> think of the &quot;add-icon&quot; as &quot;show add-controls icon&quot;, making it not modal 
</I>&gt;<i> (if modal means: there is a state of the application the user has to 
</I>&gt;<i> keep in mind, since it is not visible to him).
</I>
Yes, that sounds good.  Thanks for the clarification.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; 202. How do you change the order of the sections on a page?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;    - grab the section and drag it up or down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; aditionaly: Have attributes for the sections. Allow page to choose on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which attribute the section-display should be sorted.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you have an example in mind, where this would be useful?  My first 
</I>&gt;<i> reaction is that most users wouldn't need that feature.  Seems like it's 
</I>&gt;<i> probably enough to just let users explicitly re-order the sections, 
</I>&gt;<i> without needing to do automatic sorting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This depends on what &quot;section&quot; means. If for example on a page about a 
</I>&gt;<i> person you add sections about his children, you can order them by name, 
</I>&gt;<i> birth date, location etc.
</I>
Ah, I see.  In the current implementation &quot;section&quot; has a more 
restricted meaning.  Right now each section has an associated query and 
an associated plugin view, and the section shows that plugin view to 
show the list of items returned by the query.  In the current 
arrangement is not designed for sections that only show one item, like a 
section that shows just one of the children of a person.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; 203. How do you delete/retire a section?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;    - select the section by...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Have a trashicon in the toolbar.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a) drag the section into the trash
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; b) select trash and then select section
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Option (a) sounds good to me.  I don't like option (b) so much, 
</I>&gt;<i> because it's a modal UI.  We had talking about having a trashcan, but we 
</I>&gt;<i> got stuck because we weren't sure where on the page to put it.  If we 
</I>&gt;<i> have a toolbar then that does seem like a natural place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is the same topic as the &quot;add-icon&quot; question. Thinking b) as &quot;show 
</I>&gt;<i> delete action-buttons&quot; makes it not modal.
</I>
Okay, I see now.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; 206. Can you move a section from one page to another?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Can you include a section from one page into an other ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nope, right now a section can only appear on a single page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to think about a section as also beeing a page. Having a 
</I>&gt;<i> section in a page might expand to having a special view of a page inside 
</I>&gt;<i> another page.
</I>
That's an interesting idea.  We talked about that once, back last year, 
but didn't get around to implementing it.  I'm glad to see you raising 
the idea again.  I think we should consider doing this next time we're 
working on that part of the code.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Categories
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Allow hierarchical categories ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's not something we allow for now, but I can see where that would 
</I>&gt;<i> be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having hierarchical categories is (IMO) crucial for collecting bigger 
</I>&gt;<i> amounts of data.
</I>&gt;<i> Think about organizing your books / bibliographic data. You want to be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to do a querry about all of the data, but also about special kinds.
</I>
Yes, I guess we should start designing for that now.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; 301. If you create a new section, and create an item in the section,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; what category is the item in?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A default category for the object type being edited.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you explain a little more, or give an example?  I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> understand what you mean by &quot;the object type being edited&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm perceive categories as object hierarchies, giving new pages 
</I>&gt;<i> (objects) attribute-sets and also default values for attributs.
</I>
Okay, I think I understand.  So if you create a new section on a page 
which is about Books, then by default when you create a new item in that 
new section, the new item will be a Book.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; 706. Can you select the text within an entry and change it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;    - yes, for any type of entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;    - not in item-reference lozenges
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for item-references the text should be editable, but the widget to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; edit it should be aware of object-queries, allowing kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; autocompletion / hierarchical browsing ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Okay, so if when you select the text within an item-reference entry 
</I>&gt;<i> and change the text from &quot;Boston&quot; to &quot;Berlin&quot; (with autocompletion), 
</I>&gt;<i> then that changes the entry to point to the Berlin item, rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> simply renaming the Boston item?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Different kinds of attributes could be accompanied by different 
</I>&gt;<i> controls.
</I>&gt;<i> Choosing places could be supported by a hierarchical geographical browser,
</I>&gt;<i> limiting the available autocompletion options to something the user can 
</I>&gt;<i> quickly select from.
</I>
Right, that sounds good.

&gt;<i> In general I find multi-hierarchies (t.m. an object can have multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> parents) the best solution to help selecting along big amounts of data.
</I>
Yes -- I think that notion of multiple parents is a big part of the 
current enthusiasm about &quot;tagging&quot;.

Thanks for all the suggestions.  It may be some time before we'll get a 
chance to work on all of these, but now we have these suggestions on 
file so that we can draw on them as we're adding features.  If you're a 
programmer, let me know if you'd like to work on implementing any of this!
