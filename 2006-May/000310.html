<PRE>Hey Adam,

Thanks for posting about re-architecting OpenRecord.  It's great to be 
thinking about how we can simply the design and focus on shipping 
something usable as soon as possible.

Responses in-line...

&gt;<i> Brian and I have been talking about re-architecting OpenRecord 
</I>&gt;<i> and I thought I'd try to summarize this for the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the face-to-face meeting Brian said that one of the things
</I>&gt;<i> OpenRecord is &quot;is a usable product in Jan 2007&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To accomplish this OpenRecord needs to major changes, most 
</I>&gt;<i> important of which is that it needs to talk to a server. Also 
</I>&gt;<i> another goal of OpenRecord is to create data that doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bitrot&quot;. At the very least, this requires using a standard 
</I>&gt;<i> data format. So the idea now is to use RDF instead OR's 
</I>&gt;<i> home-grown data model.
</I>
Yes, in hindsight, we should have used RDF from the beginning.  I don't 
think it'll be too hard to switch from our home-grown data model to an 
RDF model.  Once we've done that we'll be able to take advantage of 
existing RDF data-stores and servers.  This'll be one step towards 
making it possible for people to easily get their data into and out of 
OpenRecord, and a hedge against &quot;bitrot&quot; and lock-in.

&gt;<i> Brian proposed the following steps for re-architecting:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   1. invent a data model (or meta-model) for dojo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   2. throw together some experimental dojo.data code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   3. get feedback about the design on the dojo dev list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   4. iterate on 2 and 3, improving the data handling layer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   5. merge our dojo.data layer with IBM's contribution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   6. make a couple bindings that talk to data stores
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       - a binding to Raccoon, or some RDF store
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       - simple bindings for CSV, file system files, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   7. make bindings to dojo widgets, or invite other dojo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      contributors to do that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       - table widget
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       - chart widget
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       - tree widget
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   8. port OpenRecord UI over to dojo.data model, thereby
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       making OpenRecord be able to talk to server-side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       data stores
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   (6, 7, and 8 can happen in parallel, once 1-5 are done)
</I>
At Dojo Developer Day, Chris Mitchell from IBM gave a demo of the work 
they've been doing on a dojo.data layer.  IBM is still working on that 
code, but hopefully they'll have something they're ready to contribute 
to Dojo before too long.

So, at this point, I don't think the above steps 1 to 5 make sense. 
Probably it's better to wait and see what the IBM model looks like, and 
then think about what's involved in taking that and connecting it to an 
RDF data store.

&gt;<i> However, IMHO this will still take too long to meet the 
</I>&gt;<i> Jan 2007 goal.
</I>
Yes, Jan 2007 does seem ambitious.  It would be great to make some 
simplifying assumptions if we can.

&gt;<i> So here's a straw man proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently OR has several layers including: Views (with a 
</I>&gt;<i> plugin api), Data (the data model), and Storage.  Forget 
</I>&gt;<i> about them all (for now).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead just focus on extending the Dojo table control to 
</I>&gt;<i> be fully editable: adding columns and rows, in-editing of 
</I>&gt;<i> cells, basic data validation, undo/redo, change notifications, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing this doesn't require is a binding to some data 
</I>&gt;<i> model (like the one IBM is contributing to Dojo). Instead 
</I>&gt;<i> it just has the appropriate hooks where something like that 
</I>&gt;<i> can be implemented in the future. And instead of being 
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the data model, OR can for now implement those 
</I>&gt;<i> hooks with a simple api for reading and writing RDF with 
</I>&gt;<i> some back-end (e.g. Raccoon).
</I>
I know we've talked about this before, but I'm not sure I follow.  Are 
you saying we can have a design where there simply isn't a data model 
layer?  Somehow set things up so that a change made in the table widget 
is translated directly into a call to the back-end data store, without 
having a JavaScript object in memory?

If we're going to get rid of our auto-save UI and instead have an 
explicit save button, don't we then need to have an in-memory list of 
the changes that have been made in the UI, so that we send all those 
changes to the server as one atomic operation?


&gt;<i> But if we're ignoring the View layer what about all the other 
</I>&gt;<i> layout elements? Answer: Layout is not stored as part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> data model. The code for adding sections, building queries, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> would just be like any other Dojo app -- i.e. manipulate the DOM. 
</I>&gt;<i> The layout can then be saved like any other HTML page.
</I>
Yes, in hindsight it may have been a mistake to try to save all the page 
layout info as just a bunch of items and attributes.  It seems to have a 
&quot;turtles all the way down&quot; elegance, but in practice it may not be a 
good idea to mix content data with layout data.

But, if we store the layout info by manipulating the DOM and saving it 
as HTML, that's a whole new set of work that has to get done by Jan 
2007.  Don't we then need to come up with DOM-based representations for 
the notions of pages, sections, queries, etc?  And when the user hits 
save, do we have to read through the DOM and serialize the layout info 
into HTML, while stripping out the content data?  And then we need to 
save the layout HTML via one server API and the content data via a 
different server API?

&gt;<i> Finally there's a lot of nuts &amp; bolts functionality: versioning 
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; history, user authentication &amp; authorization, conflict detection 
</I>&gt;<i> and consistency validation, etc.   These should be handled by the
</I>&gt;<i> back-end/host application (again, e.g. Raccoon).
</I>
Yes, that strikes me a huge win.  If we can think of OpenRecord as a 
plug-in that runs within some existing framework like Raccoon or 
MediaWiki, then a ton of stuff about user authentication &amp; authorization 
and whatnot get handled for us.

&gt;<i> The benefits of this approach:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * the core widgets would be broadly reusable and so hopefully will
</I>&gt;<i> attract outside support by other Dojo users
</I>&gt;<i> * this architecture is emenable to using OR as a plugin in other
</I>&gt;<i> wikis, and so hopefully will attract outside support.
</I>&gt;<i> * much less dependencies on outside tasks
</I>&gt;<i> * overall a less complex system
</I>&gt;<i> * most importantly, if we're focused, i believe we could actually ship
</I>&gt;<i> something usable in 7 months.
</I>
Yup, those sound good.  Right now OpenRecord has a bunch of custom view 
code, based on a View class which is something different from a Dojo 
widget.  That's only because we hadn't heard of Dojo back when we 
started on OpenRecord.  Eventually it would be good if the OpenRecord UI 
was composed entirely of Dojo widgets, and we got rid of all our home 
grown View code.
