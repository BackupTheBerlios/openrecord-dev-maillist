<PRE>Hi Thomas --

It's great to have a new voice on mailing list.  Thanks for all the 
suggestions about the UI questions.  It's good to have some new ideas 
getting tossed into the mix.  Up to now we've only had a half dozen 
people actively involved in the UI design.

Sorry it's taken me almost a week to respond.  It's been a busy week for 
me, what with Dojo Developer Day, and moving to a new computer, and 
coordinating Dojo's involvement in the Google &quot;Summer of Code&quot; program. 
  We're almost done with the Summer of Code application process now -- 
next week we'll find out how many students proposals have been accepted, 
and whether any of them are the ones for OpenRecord projects.

UI responses inline...

&gt;&gt;<i> 101. Autosave vs. undo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right now we have no &quot;Save&quot; button, and all changes are instantly saved.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But that means adding an &quot;Undo&quot; feature is prohibitively difficult.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But maybe we could have some sort of  revert/rollback feature that feels
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lightweight enough to be like an Undo feature. Alternatively, we could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have an &quot;Undo&quot; feature, and replace the current autosave behavior with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an explicit &quot;Save&quot; button.  Which way is better, or is there some other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hybrid solution?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Show a &quot;history&quot;-button while editing. If the user clicks on it show a
</I>&gt;<i> summary about changes to choose an old state of the object /
</I>&gt;<i> attribute. Like the history in photoshop.
</I>
Sounds good.  This one is especially topical -- one of the Summer of 
Code student proposals is about getting undo/redo implemented.  I'll 
have to go look at the photoshop UI, since I've never seen that.


&gt;&gt;<i> 104. Edit mode vs. view mode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you try to start editing a page, but you're not able to edit because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you haven't logged in yet, how do we help you figure out that you need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to log in?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Allow edit ever. Insert a message into the page alerting the user that
</I>&gt;<i> saving is active until he logs in.
</I>
Ah, good idea.  Yes, now that we're taking about having an explicit save 
button instead of auto-save, that makes your suggestion a natural 
extension.  And that way all the people who don't even have accounts can 
play around with changing page layouts and whatnot.


&gt;&gt;<i> 105. Show Tools
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can we get rid of the &quot;Show Tools&quot; button, and instead be in &quot;Show
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tools&quot; mode all the time.  How do we do that without cluttering the page
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with stuff like the &quot;New Page&quot; and &quot;New Section&quot; buttons?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Add a toolbar with one &quot;add new&quot;-button. Choosing this and selecting
</I>&gt;<i> any object a new object of this type can be added.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 201. How do you create a new section on a page?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - current solution: &quot;New Section&quot; button
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have a toolbar with actions to perform on existing objects.
</I>&gt;<i> User selects &quot;add&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> a) User selects an object.
</I>&gt;<i> UI shows options about which object can be created for this object.
</I>&gt;<i> b) User selects no object for some time:
</I>&gt;<i> Decorate the objects, for which somethig can be added.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 401. How do you create a new page?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - current solution: &quot;New Page&quot; button
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Select &quot;toolbar add&quot; and chose page-title.
</I>
Right, I think introducing a toolbar may be a good idea.  We would have 
to think about what other controls it would make sense to have on the 
toolbar.  If we do have a toolbar, maybe we can just have two buttons 
for add-page and add-section, so that adding is a one-click action, 
rather than having to click a generic add button to enter an add mode, 
and then also select an object.  We've been talking about trying to 
avoid having modes and modal interfaces, if possible.


&gt;&gt;<i> 108. Annotations for Entries
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can each Entry have other associated annotations?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - Units for numbers, like {45 mph}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - Language specifiers for strings, like {&quot;Germany&quot; lang=en} or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {&quot;Deutchland&quot; lang=de}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - Citations or annotations, like {284 cite=&quot;CIA World Factbook, page 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 84&quot;}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - Timespans, like {&quot;Leslie Lynch King, Jr.&quot; from=1913-1915}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How much work is it to have all the UI views deal with all this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Missing annotations like &quot;who changed which attribute for what reason&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> to feed the history.
</I>
Right, I'll add that to the list of annotation types.


&gt;<i> Units for numbers seems to be a different topic: this should be part
</I>&gt;<i> of the attribute type (for the example: velocity), allowing automatic
</I>&gt;<i> translation into different units.
</I>
I had only been thinking about the case where individual entries might 
have units associated with them.  But you're right, we're also going to 
want attributes themselves to have associated units (like kg or kph), or 
at least associated &quot;properties&quot; (like weight or velocity).


&gt;&gt;<i> 202. How do you change the order of the sections on a page?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - grab the section and drag it up or down
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> aditionaly: Have attributes for the sections. Allow page to choose on
</I>&gt;<i> which attribute the section-display should  be sorted.
</I>
Do you have an example in mind, where this would be useful?  My first 
reaction is that most users wouldn't need that feature.  Seems like it's 
probably enough to just let users explicitly re-order the sections, 
without needing to do automatic sorting.


&gt;&gt;<i> 203. How do you delete/retire a section?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - select the section by...
</I>&gt;<i> Have a trashicon in the toolbar.
</I>&gt;<i> a) drag the section into the trash
</I>&gt;<i> b) select trash and then select section
</I>
Option (a) sounds good to me.  I don't like option (b) so much, because 
it's a modal UI.  We had talking about having a trashcan, but we got 
stuck because we weren't sure where on the page to put it.  If we have a 
toolbar then that does seem like a natural place.


&gt;&gt;<i> 204. How do you select a section?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> by double clicking its title. what to do if there is no title ?
</I>
We have it set up now so that if you click on the title text, that 
selects the text and you can edit it.  If you double click somewhere on 
the title, that selects the word you clicked on, just like it would in a 
word processor or an e-mail client.  I think we should keep double-click 
for that use.  It'd be good if we could find some other way to select 
the section as a whole.


&gt;&gt;<i> 206. Can you move a section from one page to another?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you include a section from one page into an other ?
</I>
Nope, right now a section can only appear on a single page.


&gt;&gt;<i> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Categories
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allow hierarchical categories ?
</I>
That's not something we allow for now, but I can see where that would be 
useful.


&gt;&gt;<i> 301. If you create a new section, and create an item in the section,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what category is the item in?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A default category for the object type being edited.
</I>
Can you explain a little more, or give an example?  I don't understand 
what you mean by &quot;the object type being edited&quot;.


&gt;&gt;<i> 302. How do you create a new category?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - current solution: create a new Section, and in the query editor for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the section, type in a new category name
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having hierarchical categories:
</I>&gt;<i> - allow to add to the &quot;childrens list&quot; of categories for one category.
</I>&gt;<i> - allow to add to the &quot;parents list&quot; of categories for one category.
</I>
So we add somewhere new in the UI where you can browse the existing 
hierarchy of categories, and that's where you add new categories?


&gt;&gt;<i> 402. How do you delete/retire a page?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - right click on the nav bar menu item for the page, and select
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Retire Page&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - navigate to the page, click the &quot;Show Tools&quot; button, and then the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Retire Page&quot; button
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - drag the title  to the trashicon in the toolbar.
</I>&gt;<i> - drag the trashicon on the title
</I>&gt;<i> - select trash , then select title
</I>
If the user starts dragging somewhere on the title, I think that should 
select a region of text, just like it does in a word processor or an 
e-mail client.  So I don't think there's a good way to let the user drag 
the title to the trashcan.  Dragging the trashcan to the title doesn't 
seem intuitive to me.  I'm not familiar with any other program where you 
drag the trashcan around in order to throw things in the trash.  It 
seems like we need a way to select the page as a whole, and then drag 
the page to the trashcan.


&gt;&gt;<i> 403. How do you see a list of the deleted/retired pages?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Open the trashbin and search there.
</I>
Sounds good to me.


&gt;&gt;<i> 706. Can you select the text within an entry and change it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - yes, for any type of entry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - not in item-reference lozenges
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> for item-references the text should be editable, but the widget to
</I>&gt;<i> edit it should be aware of object-queries, allowing kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> autocompletion / hierarchical browsing ...
</I>
Okay, so if when you select the text within an item-reference entry and 
change the text from &quot;Boston&quot; to &quot;Berlin&quot; (with autocompletion), then 
that changes the entry to point to the Berlin item, rather than simply 
renaming the Boston item?


&gt;<i> Quite a lot of the suggestions rely on having a toolbar. Sorry, when I
</I>&gt;<i> missed a design desision not to have such modal input. In my opinion
</I>&gt;<i> its usefull to have &quot;a box of tools in one location&quot; to apply on
</I>&gt;<i> different objects shown on a page.
</I>
Yes, I think that sounds good.


&gt;<i> As I understood the UI should help the user to be aware of available
</I>&gt;<i> actions on objects (add new section, add new page). 
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> If there is a toolbar. the user can select the action first. The UI
</I>&gt;<i> can help him, if for some time he does not choose an object to act
</I>&gt;<i> upon.
</I>&gt;<i> Available actions on objects could also be highlighted in the toolbox
</I>&gt;<i> / bar  while hovering around the page.
</I>
Ah, another good idea.  I like that one.


Thanks for all the suggestions!
