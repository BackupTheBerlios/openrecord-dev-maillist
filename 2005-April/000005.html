<PRE>One of the open questions with our data model is how to represent the
ordering of items in a list. Here's one proposal for how to handle ordering.


Let me know what you think. Is this a practical solution, or will it leave
problems unsolved? Is there some better solution?

==============================================================
Proposal: Item Ordering in Query Result Sets

Example:
  Pat is looking at a list of things that Pat has to do. The list of items
is being displayed by the TablePlugin or the OutlinePlugin, probably within
a section on the page. The list of items being shown is the result set of
some query, like maybe a query for &quot;all items assigned to the category
'task'&quot;, or &quot;all items with an attribute 'assigned to', where the value of
the 'assigned to' attribute is 'Pat'.
  
Problem:
  Let's say the list has for items: &quot;book flight&quot;, &quot;reserve car&quot;, &quot;call
Chris&quot;, and &quot;write speech&quot;. Pat drags &quot;write speech&quot; to the top of the list,
because Pat wants it to be at the top. How do we record the fact that &quot;write
speech&quot; belongs at the top of the list?

Problem:
  Pat is looking at a different list of tasks, on some other page. That list
has 20 items on it, including &quot;book flight&quot;, &quot;reserve car&quot;, &quot;call Chris&quot;,
and &quot;write speech&quot;. Should &quot;write speech&quot; be at the top of the list? Should
it at least be above &quot;book flight&quot;, &quot;reserve car&quot;, and &quot;call Chris&quot;?

Proposal:
  I propose that we have a standard attribute called &quot;Ordinal&quot;. By default,
new items do not have an Ordinal attribute, but any item can have a value
assigned to its Ordinal attribute. 
  
  There will be a TablePlugin or OutlinePlugin (or other View code) that
displays the result set, and it's up to that code to decide what order to
display the items in. The View code may ignore the Ordinal ordering, and
instead show the items in alphabetical order, or in order based on creation
timestamp, or whatever. But if the View code wants to, it can show the items
based on their Ordinal ordering.   
 
  When a query returns a query result set, the result set is ordered based
on the Ordinal values of the items in the result set. If none of the items
have Ordinal values, the items will be in a random order. If any item has an
Ordinal value, that item will be placed above all the items without an
Ordinal value. Ordinal values will normally be positive floating point
numbers. If two items have Ordinal values, the one with the bigger value
will be placed above the one with the smaller value.
 
  When Pat drags &quot;write speech&quot; up above &quot;book flight&quot;, all we need to do is
set the Ordinal value of &quot;write speech&quot; to be some number larger than the
Ordinal value of &quot;book flight&quot;. If Pat drags &quot;write speech&quot; and drops it
*between* &quot;book flight&quot; and &quot;reserve car&quot;, we set the Ordinal value of &quot;book
flight&quot; to be the average of the Ordinal values of &quot;book flight&quot; and
&quot;reserve car&quot;.
  
  When Pat drags and drops and item in a list, we only ever change the
Ordinal value of the item Pat dragged. We don't change any attribute values
of other items.
