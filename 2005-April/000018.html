<PRE>Hi Brian,

Thanks for your helpful comments. I'll have a better look at your spec 
again tomorrow but here's a more immediate reply:

&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think of creating user stories for our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first &quot;release&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that's a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far, I think I've been more-or-less following the original 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenRecord
</I>&gt;<i> spec doc, and the staged implementation roadmap listed there:
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://openrecord.org/spec.html">http://openrecord.org/spec.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think we could draw on that spec &amp; roadmap to get user stories? 
</I>&gt;<i>  I
</I>&gt;<i> want to try doing things in a more extreme programming style, but it's 
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> new to me, so without doing more reading I don't really have a sense 
</I>&gt;<i> of what
</I>&gt;<i> our set of user stories should look like.  And I want to avoid 
</I>&gt;<i> duplicating
</I>&gt;<i> effort, if the existing spec covers a lot the same ground that user 
</I>&gt;<i> stories
</I>&gt;<i> would.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think I'm conflating user stories with some higher-level issues:
	- who are our &quot;customers&quot;?
	- From your example use cases, should we prioritize the ones that we 
should aim to target for the first release?
		- can we be more concrete about sharing and collaborating? what is 
the minimum we can shoot for?
		- what specific workflows are we aiming for in the first release?
	- how do we know we have succeeded in the first release? do we go by 
the goals, use cases, features or some other metric?								
Since we are coming at this project from different angles with 
different motivations, it may help clear the air and align our goals if 
we make all these meta-issues explicit. This isn't intended to slow 
down our pretty decent (mainly your good work!) development momentum 
tho'.

Anyway, don't want to waste our time but learning from OSAF experience, 
I think it's important to try to scope the project to be small (first 
release in 3 months), innovative and usable right from the first 
release onwards. Mitch even volunteered the same feedback today!
