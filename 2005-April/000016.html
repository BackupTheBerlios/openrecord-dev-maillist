<PRE>Hey Chao and Mignon,

Today I tried using some of the BerliOS tools for doing lightweight task
tracking.  They have web-based tools available for doing:
  * bug tracking
  * feature request tracking
  * to-do task tracking

As soon as possible, I'd like to start using OpenRecord itself to keep track
of the OpenRecord development tasks: bugs, features, and other tasks.  But,
realistically, it's going to be another couple months until the OpenRecord
data store is stable enough for that.

In the meantime, it seems like we have a few options:
 (1) We could just informally exchange e-mail messages to let each other
know about bugs or new tasks that have to get done.
 (2) We could use the BerliOS task tracking tools.  
 (3) We could just have some simple text file with a list of tasks, and we
could keep that file win the Subversion repository, and check it in and out
along with the code.

We don't need to make a decision right away, but I wanted to bring it up
because I think it dovetails with the discussion about extreme programming
(XP).  Right now I have about 20 &quot;features&quot; entered into the BerliOS feature
tracking tool.  Those features seem somewhat similar to XP &quot;user stories&quot;,
although right now the feature descriptions are probably more fine-grained
than XP user stories would be.  But, clearly we could use the BerliOS tools
to track user stories and do XP-style iteration planning, and release
planning, and &quot;project velocity&quot; tracking.

Anyway, I'll keep using the BerliOS tools myself for a while to see what I
think.  Feel free to use them too, if you'd like to check them out.  Here
are the links:
