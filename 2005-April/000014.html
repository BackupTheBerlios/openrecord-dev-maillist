<PRE>Hey Chao,

I'm cc'ing this thread to the dev list, because I think Mignon might be
interested too...

&gt;<i> | Hey Chao,
</I>&gt;<i> | 
</I>&gt;<i> | I was wrong yesterday when I was talking about 
</I>&gt;<i> | the Extreme Programming guideline about &quot;do risky 
</I>&gt;<i> | things first&quot;.  The real Extreme Programming
</I>&gt;<i> | guideline is about using spike solutions to reduce 
</I>&gt;<i> | risk.
</I>&gt;<i> | 
</I>&gt;<i> | Here's a nice Extreme Programming summary page:
</I>&gt;<i> |   <A HREF="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> | 
</I>&gt;<i> | :o) Brian
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a great link!
</I>
Yup, I added it to our bookmarks page.  I want to look at it some more
sometime.


&gt;<i> I think a &quot;quick &amp; dirty&quot; way of doing the simplest 
</I>&gt;<i> versioning would fall into spike solutions?
</I>
Agreed.  Or, perhaps a spike solution isn't worth the effort.  Maybe the
thing to do is add versioning when there are user-facing features that call
for it -- maybe things like undo, or UI for viewing changes and old
versions, or client/server performance issues. 


&gt;<i> What do you think of creating user stories for our 
</I>&gt;<i> first &quot;release&quot;? 
</I>
I think that's a good idea.  

So far, I think I've been more-or-less following the original OpenRecord
spec doc, and the staged implementation roadmap listed there:
  <A HREF="http://openrecord.org/spec.html">http://openrecord.org/spec.html</A>

Do you think we could draw on that spec &amp; roadmap to get user stories?  I
want to try doing things in a more extreme programming style, but it's all
new to me, so without doing more reading I don't really have a sense of what
our set of user stories should look like.  And I want to avoid duplicating
effort, if the existing spec covers a lot the same ground that user stories
would.


&gt;<i> I think we're fast approaching the time where we 
</I>&gt;<i> should focus on getting something usable rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than catering to different plausible directions we 
</I>&gt;<i> can move towards. 
</I>
Agreed.  


&gt;<i> Being concrete on the user stories will also help 
</I>&gt;<i> tease out tradeoffs on which direction we should 
</I>&gt;<i> point towards first?
</I>
Yes, and having concrete user stories might help highlight the similarities
and differences between the UIs we need for OpenAgenda and CoolChaser and a
dog-food release for keeping track of OpenRecord work itself.


&gt;<i> Maybe a group meeting or conf call?
</I>
I'm available for a group meeting or conference call, but I wonder if that's
the right next step.  If our next goal is to create user stories and/or
define the first release, is that something that we can do in a meeting or a
conference call?  Maybe one person needs to go off and make an initial
draft, and then we work collaboratively to refine that?
