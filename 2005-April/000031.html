<PRE>Hi Brian &amp; Mignon,

Brian asked me to elaborate some confusion about the higher-level 
vision, goals and processes of OpenRecord I have, so I'm writing them 
down below. Is this worth a meet up to discuss the issues?

Thanks,
chao

-  What is the goal of the OpenRecord?
	-  What is OpenRecord's long term vision?
	-  How would we judge OpenRecord's success in 5 years?

-  Can we go through Brian's goal as a starting point to see where 
there's agreement vs divergence? and what needs further clarification?
	-  Questions I have:
		-  is this a tool or an application? or both?
		- is there really a need for a spreadsheet on the web? what's wrong 
with using Excel to collaborate? (I sort of get it, but I feel this 
needs to be crystallized)
		-  Are we just a neutral tool, or is there a social agenda to 
OpenRecord too? e.g. force transparency?
		-  Can we elaborate on what we mean by sharing and collaboration? 
(maybe it's sufficiently explained in the use cases?)
		-  What relevant metrics should we track and try to attain to ensure 
that we are making progress towards OpenRecord's goals?
		-  who are we serving? who do we want to help or make an impact on?

-  How are we going to achieve the goals of OpenRecord?
	-  Are we agreed that (for now):
		-  We are using the Extreme Programming process to attain the 
long-term goals of OpenRecord, so that at each small short release 
cycle we are making the prioritized tangible progress towards 
OpenRecord's goals
		-  We should track metrics over time to see how well we are to 
meeting the goals and determine if we need to make course corrections
	-  If so,
		-  Which parts of Extreme Programming are we not following?
		-  What are the goals for the first release cycle?
			-  can we have a target scenario?
			-  who are our target customers for the first release cycle?
		-  Can we chart out a rough schedule for the first release to aim for?

-  Pivotal architectural questions
	-  can OpenRecord be embedded in other web pages or is it mostly 
self-contained as a website or mini-website?

-  Personal motivations (why Chao's interested in this project):
	-  Brian is a smart and fun guy to work with
	-  hope to use this technology in some of more commercial and end-user 
application projects I'm working on
	-  learn more about DHTML/AJAX technology
	-  hope to be part of something worthwhile and impactful to a lot of 
people, from the ground level
	-  I find the item-centric content model compelling - have much to 
learn there
