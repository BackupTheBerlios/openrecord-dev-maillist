<PRE>Hey Mignon &amp; Chao,

Here are some first thoughts about what we might want our client-server API
to look like. I don't have a lot of experience with web-based client-server
APIs, and I haven't thought this all through carefully, but maybe we can use
this as a starting point to iterate on.

==============================================================
Client-Server API

I can think of four or five types of calls that we might want the web
browser to make to the server:
  (1) Queries
  (2) Additions
  (3) Notifications
  (4) Page Views
  (5) RSS
  

--------------------------
(1) Queries

Context: 
  The JavaScript client code is running in the browser, and the user browses
within a page such that the client code needs to fetch more data from the
server.

Example: 
  In outline view, a user &quot;zooms in&quot; on an item, so that the client code now
needs to show all the attributes of the item, rather than just the item's
name.

Summary: 
  The JavaScript client code sends a query to the server, and the server
responds with the query result set.

Transport: 
  The query message should probably be an HTTP POST, but could maybe be an
HTTP GET. The server replies with the query result set in the response to
the HTTP POST/GET.

Data format: 
  The query message should probably be in JSON or XML, and the query result
set also in JSON or XML. Here's an example of what a JSON query might look
like:
  
  { &quot;query&quot;:               /* Query for all items in category &quot;Book&quot; */
    { &quot;uuid&quot;: 873902,      /* Unique id for the query itself */
      &quot;category&quot;: 544862   /* Books */
    }
  }
  
What's in the query message:
  A garden variety query will be something like, &quot;tell me all the current
attribute values for the item identified by UUID=834577 (The Hobbit)&quot;, or
maybe, &quot;tell me all the current attribute values for all the items that are
in the category identified by UUID=544862 (Books)&quot;.
  
  In the far-term future, we might want to have more complicated queries,
like queries that ask for all the books with &quot;Tower&quot; as part of their title.
But for now I don't think we need to worry about that.  
  
  In the nearer-term future, we might want to have queries that ask for just
particular attributes of the result set items. For example, it might be very
common to have views that would need to make queries like, &quot;tell me about
all the items that are in the category identified by UUID=544862 (Books),
but only tell me the current attribute values for the attribute identified
by UUID=216653 (Title)&quot;
  
  We'll also want to have queries that ask for information about previous
version of items, or ask about what changes have been made to an item. Maybe
something like, &quot;tell me about all the previous versions of the item
identified by UUID=834577 (The Hobbit)&quot;, or &quot;for the item identified by
UUID=834577 (The Hobbit), tell me what all the attribute values were as of
revision number 47&quot;, or &quot;... as of 2005/10/24 2:34&quot;. 
  
  Each query sent to the server should have its own unique identifier, so
that the client and server can have follow-up conversations where they refer
back to the original query.

What's in the result set:
  A garden variety result set will just be a collection of items, including
values for all the attributes of all the items. Some result sets might only
include some attribute values for some attributes, based on what the query
asked for. Or, a result set might include revision history info.  
  
  
--------------------------
(2) Additions

Context: 
  The JavaScript client code is running in the browser, and the user changes
the value of some attribute. Or, the user creates a new item, or adds a
&quot;deleted&quot; mark to an item.

Example: 
  In table view, a user clicks on a cell, and changes a text string from
&quot;Tolkien&quot; to &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien&quot;.
  
Summary: 
  The JavaScript client code sends a change object to the server to inform
the server of the new change to be added to the repository. The server
records the change in the repository and returns a confirmation to the
client.

Transport: 
  I'm assuming the addition message should be an HTTP POST. The server
replies with a confirmation in the response to the HTTP POST.

Data format: 
  The addition message should probably be in JSON or XML.
  
What's in the addition message:
  An addition message will probably just have a single change object, or a
list of change objects. I think we'll want to have at least a few different
types of change objects: change objects for creating new items, change
objects for assigning attribute values, and change objects for marking items
as deleted.
  
  In a simple change object for assigning an attribute value, there might
just be the UUID of the item being changed, the UUID of the attribute being
set, and the new data value. But, the change objects could get more
complicated, depending on what the core data model ends up looking like.
More on that later.

 
--------------------------
(3) Notifications

Context: 
  The JavaScript client code is running in the browser, and it periodically
checks with the server to find out if any of the other clients have made any
changes to any of the items being displayed in this client.
  
Example: 
  Pat is looking at a list of the 24 books that were returned in the result
set of some query. Pat goes to the bathroom. Chris happens to also be
looking at one of those books. Chris changes the author of one of the books
from &quot;Tolkien&quot; to &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien&quot;. When Pat comes back from the bathroom,
Pat's screen shows the author as &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien&quot;.

Summary: 
  The client code polls the server to check for any update notifications
associated with a previous query. If there have been any changes that impact
the query result set, the server returns information about the changes, and
the client code refreshes the screen to show the changes.

Transport: 
  The notification request message should probably be an HTTP POST, but
could maybe be an HTTP GET. The server replies with update notifications in
the response to the HTTP POST/GET.
  
Data format: 
  The notification request message and the resulting update notifications
should probably both be in JSON or XML.
  
What's in the notification request message:
  I think the notification request message just needs to provide the unique
identifier of the original query.
  
What's in the resulting update notification:
  Most of the time, there won't have been any changes that impact the query
result set, so the update notification will just have to say that: &quot;no
changes&quot;. When there have been changes, the update notification will be a
list of change objects. Potentially, these might be the exact same change
objects that the server received in the addition messages when some client
originally made the changes. 


--------------------------
(4) Page Views

Context:
  A user launches their browser, and types in a URL for a web page served by
the server. No OpenRecord page has been loaded yet, and no JavaScript client
code is running in the browser. 
  
Example 1: 
  A search engine like Google is trying to index my page of favorite books,
after following a link to the page from some page on some other web site.
For Google to be able to index the page, our server needs to return a bunch
of HTML that's already laid out with lists and tables containing strings
that reflect the attribute values of my favorite books. We can't rely on
JavaScript client code to execute a query and fill in the page.
  
Example 2:
  90% of users will just view static pages, without ever editing anything.
If a user follows a link to one of our pages, the page should appear
quickly, without the need for loading JavaScript client code and running
queries and whatnot. Ideally pages should be viewable by people using
browsers that don't have JavaScript.
  
Summary: 
  The server has a cache of static HTML pages that it can hand out in
response to requests. The server updates the cached pages when needed (or
drops pages from the cache). If the server gets a request for a page that
isn't in the cache, the server can build a new static HTML page from the
information in the repository, and add that page to the cache.
  
Transport: 
  The request is a simple HTTP GET.  The response is some static HTML.
 
  
--------------------------
(5) RSS

Example:
  In Pat's RSS reader, Pat has subscribed to an RSS feed for all the new
Bugs filed against a product. Or, in Chris's RSS reader, Chris has
subscribed to an RSS feed to see all the comments posted in response to a
proposal.
  
Summary: 
  I don't know much about RSS, so I don't know what the server needs to do
to provide the info the RSS reader needs. I don't think this is too hard to
do, but it's certainly not a near-term feature anyway.
