<PRE>I just found out about the MusicBrainz project, and I wanted to share it
with you:
  <A HREF="http://www.musicbrainz.org/">http://www.musicbrainz.org/</A>

I've only spent an hour or so looking at it, but it's a cool project, and a
bunch of what they're doing is similar to what I had in mind for OpenRecord
and OpenAgenda.  I'm not actually much interested in music, but it's a
wonderful example of a feature-rich web-based collaborative database...


Things of interest:


(1) A web-based collaborative database

MusicBrainz is doing Wikipedia-style web-based collaboration and content
aggregation, but MusicBrainz does it with structured database entries, not
text-based wiki pages.



(2) Item relationships

MusicBrainz is *not* a big flat-file database, but rather a database where
different types of records are all interrelated.  In MusicBrainz there are
relationships between artists, bands, albums, tracks, URLs, etc.  (This is
the way Wikiquotes should be set up, but isn't, with relationships between
books, authors, quotes, etc. -- or at least, wasn't, last time I looked.)



(3) Extensible schema

MusicBrainz started out with a fixed content schema that only knew about
artists, albums, tracks, and a couple other things.  They've now got an
&quot;Advanced Relationships&quot; feature, which will allow for all sorts of new
content types and relationships.  For more info, see:
<A HREF="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/wiki.pl?AdvancedRelationshipType">http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/wiki.pl?AdvancedRelationshipType</A>



(4) Voting to establish content

MusicBrainz has a content moderation system based on voting and automatic
resolution of votes, like what I'm proposing for OpenRecord.  In contrast to
the wiki-style system of &quot;last edit wins&quot;, or the Content Management System
approach of &quot;process and permissions&quot;.  For more info, see:
<A HREF="http://www.musicbrainz.org/mod_intro.html">http://www.musicbrainz.org/mod_intro.html</A>



(5) UUID-based URLs

MusicBrainz uses UUIDs to identify content items, just like Chandler and
JCR.  I think OpenRecord should do that too.  MusicBrainz also uses UUIDs
for their permanent URLs, which I think is great.  For example:
<A HREF="http://musicbrainz.org/album/5240094f-9d79-44fd-9985-77c7287bcc16.html">http://musicbrainz.org/album/5240094f-9d79-44fd-9985-77c7287bcc16.html</A>
  


(6) RDF and Web Services

MusicBrainz publishes all the database content not only on human-readable
HTML pages, but also in machine-readable form via RDF and Web Services.  For
more info see: <A HREF="http://logicerror.com/musicbrainzArticle">http://logicerror.com/musicbrainzArticle</A> or
<A HREF="http://crschmidt.net/blog/archives/47/menow-and-musicbrainz/">http://crschmidt.net/blog/archives/47/menow-and-musicbrainz/</A>



(7) Open source, open content

The MusicBrainz source code is all either GPL and LGPL.  

Some of the MusicBrainz database content is under the Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license.  The core MusicBrainz data is
under the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication, which is what the
OpenRecord project is operating under.



(8) Transparent finances

MusicBrainz is run by the MetaBrainz foundation, which prides themselves on
&quot;transparent finances&quot;.  Very much in the same spirit as the openness stuff
I was advocating on the OpenAgenda site.  For more info, see:
<A HREF="http://metabrainz.org/finances/">http://metabrainz.org/finances/</A>



(9) Interesting people

All sorts of interesting people have been involved:

Board of directors includes:
 * Dan Brickley of W3C and the FOAF Project
 * Cory Doctorow of Electronic Frontier Foundation
 * Lawrence Lessig of Stanford Law School and Creative Commons

Sponsors include:
 * O'Reilly and Associates

Contributors include:
 * Aaron Swartz of the W3C's RDF Core Working Group
