<PRE>Hey Chao,

Thanks for the links!  The &quot;lower case&quot; semantic web is intriguing,
especially since the &quot;upper case&quot; Semantic Web has so little momentum.  

&gt;<i> Today, Mitch Kapor introduced me to an intriguing concept 
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;Microformats&quot; ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats">http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://complexspiral.com/events/archive/2005/sxsw/">http://complexspiral.com/events/archive/2005/sxsw/</A> 
</I>
I think Jon Udell is also an advocate of this kind of &quot;Microformat&quot; mark-up.
I've been using the rel=&quot;license&quot; mark-up on the pages I've been making.  

We should keep an eye out to see what other Microformat standards emerge,
and then have our pages play nicely with the de facto standards.  But, other
than having our pages use those standards, I'm not sure what to do with the
whole Microformat thing.  I mean, it's tempting to think that we could
somehow simply just use the Microformats as our intrinsic data
representation format, but I think that just doesn't work.  Let's talk more
about it when we're in the same room.


&gt;<i> Following our Monday discussion, one area left undiscussed 
</I>&gt;<i> that has been nagging me is whether our approach in OpenRecord 
</I>&gt;<i> is the right one. Specifically, are we chunking our unit of 
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration in the right packet size. I think items and 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes are absolutely the right way to go, but should the 
</I>&gt;<i> unit of collaboration be one repository? one data-driven 
</I>&gt;<i> website? (Brian, maybe I'm not getting the full vision of 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenRecord?)
</I>
Let's talk more about this issue on Monday.  I've maybe been being vague
about this, because I'm still mulling it over in my head.  The easiest thing
to do would be to have each website have its own repository, so that each
website/repository is a world unto itself.  That's the simplest thing to do,
so that's probably where we should start.  

Later on it would be cool to do all sorts of intertwingling of items across
different web sites -- across both OpenRecord based sites and other sites
that publish items in formats we can read, or other sites that can read
formats that we can publish.


&gt;<i> Specific concerns:
</I>&gt;<i> - how do we leverage and interoperate with the rest of the world?
</I>&gt;<i>    - how do we intertwingle with outside data?
</I>
This needs more thought.  We could do a number of fairly simple things, like
automatically generating pages with RDF format versions of our items, so
that those pages can be reached by search engines, or by RDF-crawlers.  Or
we could think about using RSS as our standard means for communicating
update notifications from the server to the client.  Or we could have our
server automatically import data from other servers.  But, in the spirit of
extreme programming, we should maybe start off by identifying the user
stories we want to cover, and then prioritizing those to see where that
leads us.


&gt;<i> - are we sufficiently leveraging and building on existing tools, 
</I>&gt;<i> standards and infrastructure, especially web-related ones?
</I>
Yup, I'm also worried that we're building too much from scratch.  But, I
don't see how to avoid it.  I keep looking at existing tools and frameworks,
but they mostly don't look like clear wins for us.  

This week I spent a couple hours reading about JCR, and JSR-170, and Apache
Jackrabbit.  That seems like a big important piece of emerging standards and
infrastructure, and I'd love to use that instead of building our own
server/repository.  But I don't think that using Jackrabbit would actually
help us.  Jackrabbit looks like a great fit for Chandler, but for OpenRecord
it doesn't seem to match that well.  It looks like it's really good at a
bunch of things we don't need, but doesn't seem to have features to address
the problems that we expect to face.  Similarly, I spent some time this week
reading about RDF, and Jena, and existing RDF servers and query languages
and frameworks.  There's some cool stuff, but it doesn't seem to solve our
problems.  Wanh. 


&gt;<i> - as Brian Totty suggested, should we be thinking of embedding 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenRecord in existing websites instead of building new ones 
</I>&gt;<i> from the ground up?
</I>
If we could embed OpenRecord in existing websites, I think that would lead
to much faster and more widespread adoption of OpenRecord.  That would be
great, if we could do it.

However, that would only be practical if we could do it with a single
&quot;plug-and-play&quot; snippet that we make available to people authoring pages at
those sites.  That may be technically impossible, but I don't know for sure.
If we can't do that, then in order to &quot;serve&quot; OpenRecord content into
existing websites, all of the web servers for all of those sites would have
to have code that knows about OpenRecord, which seems like a huge barrier to
adoption.

At some point when we have time, it would be great to do a little
&quot;spike-solution&quot; experiment, to see if it's possible to embed an OpenRecord
view on a page that's hosted by a server that's not an OpenRecord server,
and then have the OpenRecord view fetch data from an OpenRecord server.


I'm looking forward to meeting up on Monday.  We can talk more about all of
this stuff!
