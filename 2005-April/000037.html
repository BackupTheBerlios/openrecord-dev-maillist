<PRE>Hi Brian,

I really enjoyed reading this. You express the ideas beautifully. As 
you allude to, I'm also in favor of 1) outsider-orientation 2) 
bazaar-style emergent &quot;collaboration&quot;.

In a bazaar-style repository, wouldn't there be some data that would 
still be cathedral style? e.g. the URL in a book, the tax id of a 
charity or the title of a book? (maybe this is because I don't 
understanding the voting methodology well enough)

Two other issues occurred to me that seem related to this discussion:
a) Distributed vs. centralized repository
Where is the data stored? Can items only refer to other items in the 
*same* repository? Both wikipedia and del.icio.us are centralized 
repositories. Both use links as means to connect up with data from the 
rest of the world, as kind of a second-class means. In contrast, the 
web is the ultimate distributed repository.

b) Where is the data used or deployed?
While the wikipedia and del.icio.us websites are by far the main ways 
in which users interact with the data stored in the two systems. What 
is interesting about del.icio.us is that it has an open api to directly 
access the data in both a *read* and *write* fashion for each user's 
own data (since it's bazaar-style). A whole slew of del.icio.us related 
apps and websites have sprouted leveraging on the api, contributing I 
believe a great deal to the success of del.icio.us. Similarly, Flickr 
is another good example of profiting from this direction. (b) is 
obviously a grey-continuum rather than binary (how much do you want to 
open up the api?). For example, wikipedia could offer RSS feeds to each 
page.

c) Kind of an amalgam of (a) &amp; (b), do we want the ability to 
incorporate data from other sources which have open APIs such as 
del.icio.us and flickr, in a first-class (e.g. item-centric, not just 
one-time import) kind of way?

As Brian mentioned, I think we should use the XP model and use cases to 
decide whether and when to incorporate the above features. My personal 
bias would be to think about (b) web APIs sooner versus distributed 
repositories or external data (a) &amp; (c).

On your &quot;data structures&quot; section and below, I think you'll have to 
explain it to me in greater detail and maybe face-to-face. My head is 
spinning a little. Some immediate questions:

- what is the difference between an item and an attribute? are 
attributes a special kind of item? in what way?
	- is it that items cannot refer to other items except via an attribute?
- is voting the only or the best way to create a bazaar-style system? I 
would like to explore this area deeper before deciding on &quot;voting&quot; as 
the means to aggregate the emergent &quot;wisdom of the crowds&quot; view. Is 
voting done implicitly or explicitly by the user? I think this is where 
we need to discuss ui and user scenarios together with data model.

Apologies for not responding earlier, I've only caught up with the 
mailing list now. But your email seems very appropriate for tomorrow's 
discussion. I think we need to approach tomorrow's discussion from both 
a top-down approach (e.g. like the questions I posed) and a bottoms-up 
approach (what is technically do-able easily as a first step) which the 
data model should shed light on.

</I>&gt;<i> most of it already. Even if we don't act on it now, we'll have it 
</I>&gt;<i> future
</I>&gt;<i> reference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Background:
</I>&gt;<i>   A lot of the OpenRecord design was inspired by existing web-based
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration projects, like Wikipedia and del.icio.us. I've never 
</I>&gt;<i> actually
</I>&gt;<i> used del.icio.us, and I'm only a little more familiar with Wikipedia, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I
</I>&gt;<i> still want to draw on them as collaboration examples.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Wikipedia and del.icio.us are both &quot;outsider-oriented&quot; collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> projects, rather than &quot;workgroup-scale&quot; collaboration projects. By
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;outsider-oriented&quot;, I mean that there's a single repository that's
</I>&gt;<i> potentially viewed and edited by thousands or millions of people, and 
</I>&gt;<i> those
</I>&gt;<i> people generally don't know each other. By &quot;workgroup-scale&quot;, I mean 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> each workgroup has its own little repository, with any given workgroup 
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> having a few dozen people. An example of a workgroup-scale 
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> tool might be the bug-tracking tool used by corporate software 
</I>&gt;<i> development
</I>&gt;<i> team.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   In workgroup-scale collaboration, you can safely assume that 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much on the same page, and you don't need a lot of formal 
</I>&gt;<i> process and
</I>&gt;<i> structure. Or, even if people aren't on the same page, you can assume 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> they're able to get together in a room and figure out what they want 
</I>&gt;<i> to do,
</I>&gt;<i> so they don't need the collaboration tool itself to have features for
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with differences of opinion. In practice, everyone can have 
</I>&gt;<i> full
</I>&gt;<i> read/edit permission to everything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   With outsider-oriented collaboration, you begin to have more 
</I>&gt;<i> substantial
</I>&gt;<i> problems with differences of opinion. For example, some Wikipedia 
</I>&gt;<i> pages are
</I>&gt;<i> prone to &quot;edit wars&quot;, where different users keep pushing a page in 
</I>&gt;<i> different
</I>&gt;<i> directions. I think the Wikipedia project has evolved some mechanisms 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with edit wars. I think those mechanisms involve having different
</I>&gt;<i> classes of users (editors vs. authors), and maybe some structure for 
</I>&gt;<i> how
</I>&gt;<i> things happen (propose, discuss, vote, action).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   In contrast, I believe that del.icio.us does not have any mechanisms 
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with differences of opinion. There are no editors, no 
</I>&gt;<i> procedures, no
</I>&gt;<i> discussion, and no edit wars. And I think that's because Wikipedia is a
</I>&gt;<i> Cathedral, where del.icio.us is a Bazaar. They're both 
</I>&gt;<i> outsider-oriented
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration projects, but with del.icio.us the collaboration is a
</I>&gt;<i> lightweight, emergent thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   With del.icio.us, each person adds their own content, and each 
</I>&gt;<i> person can
</I>&gt;<i> only edit the content that they created. The collaboration value simply
</I>&gt;<i> comes from showing aggregate views of the content that lots of people 
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> contributed. Collaboration is easy, because each user can make edits
</I>&gt;<i> entirely independently from everybody else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Wikipedia has some Bazaar-like qualities too. Each Wikipedia page is
</I>&gt;<i> almost completely independent of all the other pages. In some sense, 
</I>&gt;<i> you can
</I>&gt;<i> think of Wikipedia as a collection of 500,000 independent collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> projects, one for each page. So if I'm editing one page, and you're 
</I>&gt;<i> editing
</I>&gt;<i> another, then we're both collaborating to create Wikipedia, but the
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration is really just Bazaar-style aggregation, just like
</I>&gt;<i> del.icio.us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   However, any single Wikipedia page is like a little Cathedral. All 
</I>&gt;<i> of the
</I>&gt;<i> contributors to a page work together to create a coherent unified 
</I>&gt;<i> whole. One
</I>&gt;<i> person adds some content, and a second person edits that content. The
</I>&gt;<i> changes that people make build on previous changes. Each contribution 
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> highly dependent on the previous contributions, not independent like 
</I>&gt;<i> in the
</I>&gt;<i> del.icio.us case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Goal #1, outsider-oriented:
</I>&gt;<i>   My goal with OpenRecord is to create an outsider-oriented 
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> tool, not a workgroup-scale collaboration tool. A workgroup-scale tool 
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> be easier to build, so it's tempting to start with that goal, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> think
</I>&gt;<i> that would lead us astray. I believe both CoolChaser and OpenAgenda are
</I>&gt;<i> inherently outsider-oriented projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Goal #2, Bazaar-style:
</I>&gt;<i>   If possible, I'd like to create more of a Bazaar-style tool instead 
</I>&gt;<i> of a
</I>&gt;<i> Cathedral-style tool. As much as possible, I'd like users to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> create and edit content more-or-less independently of each other, and 
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> have the tool aggregate that content. That may not be a feasible goal, 
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> I'd at least like to try. So, that said, here's my proposal for the 
</I>&gt;<i> next
</I>&gt;<i> iteration of the core data structures and the data model API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Data structures:
</I>&gt;<i>   * The server keeps a database of items
</I>&gt;<i>   * Items have values associated with them
</I>&gt;<i>     + an item has values &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien&quot;, &quot;1938&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * Values can be assigned to attributes
</I>&gt;<i>     + &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is assigned to the &quot;Title&quot; attribute
</I>&gt;<i>     + &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien&quot; is assigned to the &quot;Author&quot; attribute
</I>&gt;<i>     + &quot;1938&quot; is assigned to the &quot;Publication Date&quot; attribute
</I>&gt;<i>   * An item can have values that are *not* assigned to an attribute
</I>&gt;<i>     + an item can have value &quot;Fiction&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * An attribute is itself just another item
</I>&gt;<i>   * An item can have many values assigned to an attribute
</I>&gt;<i>     + &quot;Star Wars&quot; can have a &quot;People&quot; attribute with values &quot;Luke
</I>&gt;<i> Skywalker&quot;, &quot;Princess Leia&quot;, &quot;Han Solo&quot;, &quot;Darth Vader&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * A value can be a literal, like a string or a number
</I>&gt;<i>   * A value can be a reference to another item
</I>&gt;<i>   * A value is not itself an item
</I>&gt;<i>   * Values are immutable
</I>&gt;<i>   * We start out with an initial set of common attributes:
</I>&gt;<i>     + name, summary, category, start date, end date, short name
</I>&gt;<i>   * We have a variety of types of literals
</I>&gt;<i>     + string
</I>&gt;<i>     + number
</I>&gt;<i>     + date
</I>&gt;<i>     + URL
</I>&gt;<i>   * String literals can have an associated &quot;language&quot;, which
</I>&gt;<i>     is a reference to an item representing a language, like
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;English&quot; or &quot;German&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * Number literals can have an associated &quot;unit&quot;, which is a
</I>&gt;<i>     reference to an item representing a measurement unit, like
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;miles&quot; or &quot;dollars&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Each item has a unique id -- unique across all servers
</I>&gt;<i>   * Each value has a unique id -- unique within a single item
</I>&gt;<i>   * Each item has a creation stamp, with a timestamp marking when
</I>&gt;<i>     it was created and a userstamp with a reference to an item
</I>&gt;<i>     representing the user who created it.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Each value has a creation stamp with a timestamp and a userstamp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Operations -- single user:
</I>&gt;<i>   * create a new item
</I>&gt;<i>   * vote to delete an item
</I>&gt;<i>   * subsequent to deletion, vote to retain an item, thereby 
</I>&gt;<i> un-deleting it
</I>&gt;<i>   * create a new value in an item, optionally assigned to an attribute
</I>&gt;<i>   * add a new value to an attribute of an item
</I>&gt;<i>     + add &quot;C3PO&quot; as one of the &quot;People&quot; in &quot;Star Wars&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * vote to delete a value
</I>&gt;<i>     + mark &quot;Spock&quot; as deleted, so that it no longer appears in &quot;Star 
</I>&gt;<i> Wars&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * vote to replace a value with a corrected value
</I>&gt;<i>     + replace &quot;Luck Skywalker&quot; with &quot;Luke Skywalker&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     + this creates a new value &quot;Luke Skywalker&quot;, votes to delete
</I>&gt;<i>       the old value &quot;Luck Skywalker&quot;, and marks the old value with
</I>&gt;<i>       a pointer to the new replacement value
</I>&gt;<i>   * change the ordering of the values in an attribute of an item
</I>&gt;<i>   * change the ordering of the items in a query result set
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Operations -- second user, editing the work of the first user:
</I>&gt;<i>   * vote to retain -- mark a value as affirmed
</I>&gt;<i>     + affirm that &quot;C3PO&quot; is one of the &quot;People&quot; in &quot;Star Wars&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * add a new value to an attribute of an item
</I>&gt;<i>     + add &quot;R2D2&quot; as one of the &quot;People&quot; in &quot;Star Wars&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * vote to delete a value
</I>&gt;<i>     + mark &quot;Spock&quot; as deleted, or affirm someone else's deletion
</I>&gt;<i>   * replace a value with a corrected value
</I>&gt;<i>     + creates a new value and votes to delete the old value
</I>&gt;<i>   * vote to delete an item
</I>&gt;<i>     + mark &quot;Star Wars&quot; as deleted, or affirm someone else's deletion
</I>&gt;<i>   * vote to retain an item
</I>&gt;<i>   * change the ordering of the values in an attribute of an item
</I>&gt;<i>   * change the ordering of the items in a query result set
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Data structures redux:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Item
</I>&gt;<i>      + uuid
</I>&gt;<i>      + set of values
</I>&gt;<i>      + creation stamp (timestamp and userstamp)
</I>&gt;<i>      + creation ordinal (a default initial value)

</I>&gt;<i>          where T is (January 1, 2000)
</I>&gt;<i>        - optimization: can be derived from the creation stamp,
</I>&gt;<i>          no need to store it
</I>&gt;<i>      + optional list of votes to delete and votes to retain
</I>&gt;<i>        - each vote has a stamp (timestamp and userstamp)

</I>&gt;<i>   * Value

</I>&gt;<i>      + maybe an optional source (a reference to another item)
</I>&gt;<i>   * Literal Value
</I>&gt;<i>      + data type (string, number, date, etc.)
