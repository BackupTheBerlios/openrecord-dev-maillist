Alex Russell will be showing off the Dojo toolkit this Friday evening.
He'll be giving a demo at "SuperHappyDevHouse #4" in Hillsborough.  I'm
planning on going.  Here's more info...

Message-ID: <200509131946.j8DJkK127572@bat.berlios.de>

Hey Mignon,

I was thinking more about our conversation about the ViewPlugin registration
API, and how to assign UUIDs to ViewPlugins, and I remembered another one of
the original design goals -- namely that we'd really like the ViewPlugin's
UUID to uniquely identify it across a number of repositories, not just the
repository that the ViewPlugin is currently being installed in.  That could
complicate things.  Give me a call sometime before you start to work on it
and we can talk through the issues.

Hi Brian,

Thanks for sharing this. Sounds fun.

I've got a friend visiting from Singapore and I it thought it'll be a  
good intro into silicon valley if I brought him along, but probably  
after dinner. Maybe around 9pm?

Are you planning on showing Open Record? Sounds like a good venue.

Sounds good.  I'm planning on arriving there at 7:00 and staying at least a
couple hours, so I should see you there.

I'd definitely like to show Open Record to Alex, and maybe we'll end up
showing it to other people too.

If you've got a few minutes to kill, here's a short movie that shows off the
new Zimbra web-based e-mail and calendaring tool.  It's a nice example of an
AJAX UI:
