<PRE>Brian, I would like to learn, why public domain  is problematic for 
software projects.

I thought up to now, that Python, is published as &quot;public domain&quot;.
But I looked closer 
(<A HREF="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.2/license/">http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.2/license/</A>)  and in fact,
python is not distributed as public domain but with a license, giving 
you most of the
benefits of public domain

    '' GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.''
   
but still is a license which forces you

- to keep the copyright info in it
- to accept the software &quot;as it is&quot;


Publishing software as PD gives you no license at all, but software 
developers
and publishers need at least be protected from possible infringements.

Is this the point ?

I share this letter with the &quot;working in parallel&quot; mailinglist of
minciu sodas (<A HREF="http://www.ms.lt/">http://www.ms.lt/</A>) and hope you feel comfortable with that.

</I>&gt;<i> When I started OpenRecord, back in 2005, I started it as a public domain 
</I>&gt;<i> project, using a public domain dedication (PDD) instead of an open 
</I>&gt;<i> source license.  My goal was to distribute the code with no 
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions, so that anyone could take all of the code, or any small 
</I>&gt;<i> part of it, and use it for any purpose.  When we became a project of the 
</I>&gt;<i> Dojo Foundation, we agreed to also distribute the code under the 
</I>&gt;<i> Academic Free License (AFL), the standard license used by all Dojo 
</I>&gt;<i> Foundation projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since then, I've been gradually learning more about public domain 
</I>&gt;<i> dedications -- reading FAQs, talking with attorneys, and corresponding 
</I>&gt;<i> with other open source developers.  It's become increasingly clear that 
</I>&gt;<i> using the PDD is problematic.  It's also problematic to try to use the 
</I>&gt;<i> PDD in conjunction with the AFL.  Last week our own attorney gave me her 
</I>&gt;<i> advice on the matter, confirming what I had heard elsewhere.  If you're 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in the gnarly details, let me know, and I can post a quick 
</I>&gt;<i> summary about why the PDD is problematic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on the advice we've gotten, I believe we should stop running 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenRecord as a public domain project, and instead simply distribute the 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenRecord code using the AFL, a conventional open source license.  We 
</I>&gt;<i> might also consider dual-licensing under both the AFL and the BSD 
</I>&gt;<i> License, as the Dojo Toolkit does.  I'm planning to raise this issue 
</I>&gt;<i> over on the dojo-contributors mailing list, where we can have a vote of 
</I>&gt;<i> the dojo committers and (hopefully) get approval for the change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the dojo committers approve of change, then the old code in our SVN 
</I>&gt;<i> repository would continue to be in the public domain (up to revision N), 
</I>&gt;<i> but revision N+1 would be a derivative work that would be licensed under 
</I>&gt;<i> the AFL (and perhaps BSD) but would not be placed in the public domain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to placing the OpenRecord source code in the public domain, 
</I>&gt;<i> we've also been placing all the ancillary material in the public domain: 
</I>&gt;<i> the screencasts, the web site, the posts to the mailing list, etc.  At 
</I>&gt;<i> some point we might want to revisit that decision, but the PDD is not as 
</I>&gt;<i> problematic for those uses as it was for the source code, so for now I 
</I>&gt;<i> think it's fine to keep using the PDD for that content.
