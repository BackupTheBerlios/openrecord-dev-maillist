<PRE>For those of you who are interested in the finer points of open source 
licensing...

When I started OpenRecord, back in 2005, I started it as a public domain 
project, using a public domain dedication (PDD) instead of an open 
source license.  My goal was to distribute the code with no 
restrictions, so that anyone could take all of the code, or any small 
part of it, and use it for any purpose.  When we became a project of the 
Dojo Foundation, we agreed to also distribute the code under the 
Academic Free License (AFL), the standard license used by all Dojo 
Foundation projects.

Since then, I've been gradually learning more about public domain 
dedications -- reading FAQs, talking with attorneys, and corresponding 
with other open source developers.  It's become increasingly clear that 
using the PDD is problematic.  It's also problematic to try to use the 
PDD in conjunction with the AFL.  Last week our own attorney gave me her 
advice on the matter, confirming what I had heard elsewhere.  If you're 
interested in the gnarly details, let me know, and I can post a quick 
summary about why the PDD is problematic.

Based on the advice we've gotten, I believe we should stop running 
OpenRecord as a public domain project, and instead simply distribute the 
OpenRecord code using the AFL, a conventional open source license.  We 
might also consider dual-licensing under both the AFL and the BSD 
License, as the Dojo Toolkit does.  I'm planning to raise this issue 
over on the dojo-contributors mailing list, where we can have a vote of 
the dojo committers and (hopefully) get approval for the change.

If the dojo committers approve of change, then the old code in our SVN 
repository would continue to be in the public domain (up to revision N), 
but revision N+1 would be a derivative work that would be licensed under 
the AFL (and perhaps BSD) but would not be placed in the public domain.

In addition to placing the OpenRecord source code in the public domain, 
we've also been placing all the ancillary material in the public domain: 
the screencasts, the web site, the posts to the mailing list, etc.  At 
some point we might want to revisit that decision, but the PDD is not as 
problematic for those uses as it was for the source code, so for now I 
think it's fine to keep using the PDD for that content.
