<PRE>Hey Chao,

&gt;<i> I showed Mimi how to check out the latest version 
</I>&gt;<i> of Open Record through SVN. Unfortunately, the current  
</I>&gt;<i> version she checked out (today around 1.30pm) resulted 
</I>&gt;<i> in a lot of alerts() (I'm guessing for debugging) being 
</I>&gt;<i> displayed whenever she saved an entry.
</I>
Yesterday I installed Firefox on my new Windows notebook, which meant I had
convenient access to a brand new copy of Firefox that had never run the
OpenRecord code which seeks permission to save to the local file system.  

As a test, I tried to duplicate the events that might have happened on
Mimi's machine.  I opened an OpenRecord document from a &quot;<A HREF="file://">file://</A>&quot; path and
made some small edit.  I got the normal dialog box asking me for permission
to write to the local file system.  I hit the &quot;Allow&quot; button, but I did not
check the &quot;Remember this decision&quot; check-box.  My edit did get recorded in
the JSON repository file, and I did not get any alert() messages showing up.


Then I made another edit, and I got the exact same dialog box asking me for
permission to write to the local file system.  I repeated that a couple more
times, but every time it worked just the way you would expect it to, without
any alert() messages.

So, I think we should rule out the &quot;Remember this decision&quot; check-box as a
factor in the problem.  Unfortunately, I have no clue what else might be
causing the problem.  I think we'd have to debug on Mimi's machine in order
to figure out what's up, but I'm hoping maybe the problem will just go away
of its own accord when Mimi gets the latest copy of the source code!
