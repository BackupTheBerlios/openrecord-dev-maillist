<PRE>Hi Brian,

Looks fantastic, I like the succinct graphics! I think you've  
captured the main points very well, raised the right issues and have  
a great flow!

More detailed comments:
Slide 2: I'm not sure if people have a reference point for what 1200  
man-hours mean. As a talking point, you could explain that it's  
basically you: 3 days/week, chao 1-2 days/week Mignon: 1day?

Slide 3: I get the basic concept. But I've some dissonance because  
the horizontal axis isn't a continuum. They seem to be disparate  
categories, with not very apparent relationships

Slide 4: I'd to pitch the target areas I'm interested in (but maybe  
they're not where your interests are?). They're mainly around social  
lightweight collaboration:
     - bookclub, investment club
     - trip/travel planning
     - small research project e.g. family genealogy,
     - knowledge base for advocacy group: e.g. facts about broadcast  
flag, Sudan, etc.

Slide 5: Great slide! Maybe highlight what is a view in the main  
diagram (pointers to Computers table and Printers outline)

Slide 6: another great slide! You may need to talk about concept of  
&quot;units&quot; since you have sq. km as an example.

Slide 7: Wow, lots of useful info here. Small questions:
     - Items can be tagged by anyone, not just the creator of the  
item, right? So, we should support queries to view items tagged just  
by myself (or any single individual) and also queries to view items  
tagged by everybody (i.e. just like delicious)?
     - After hearing Jimmy Wales talk, should we support anonymous  
writes?

Slide 8: We want to state in the longer run, we will have support  
beyond Firefox, right? What about architecture to support OR in 3rd  
party sites? Do we want to talk about that?

Slide 9: don't know enough to comment

I think a slide about how we fit in, and position ourselves with/ 
against Wikipedia would be interesting and fruitful for discussion.  
Also, I think Mitch is interested in collaborative decision making.  
Doesn't need to be in the prep material, but I think it should be one  
focus in our discussions. I like the demo we discussed about how we  
can make decisions to be more fact-based and criteria-based.

This is great, very useful recruiting/marketing material.

Hope this helps,
chao
