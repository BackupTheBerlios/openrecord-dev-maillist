<PRE>Hey Chao,

Thanks for all the detailed feedback!  

I just checked in a new version of the slides with changes based on your
feedback.  So far I've made just the smaller changes, and I haven't yet
added any new pages because I'm not sure what the new pages would look like.

If you're feeling inspired over the weekend, you can have a go at adding new
pages or restructuring what's there.  You can edit the slides in
OpenOffice.org Draw, 2.0 Beta, which is easy to download and install.  Or we
can walk through the slides together when we meet up on Monday, and
brainstorm about additions and improvements. 


&gt;<i> Slide 3: I get the basic concept. But I've some 
</I>&gt;<i> dissonance because the horizontal axis isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> continuum. They seem to be disparate categories, 
</I>&gt;<i> with not very apparent relationships
</I>
Yup, that bothered me some too.  The horizontal axis may have a loose
continuum from &quot;unstructured&quot; to &quot;structured&quot;, but only some of the
categories really fall into that continuum, and the others have to be taken
with a grain of salt.  Unfortunately, I can't think how to fix that problem
without radically altering the slide and cutting lots of important ideas out
of it.  Let's talk about it on Monday and see if we can come up with
something better.


&gt;<i> Slide 4: I'd to pitch the target areas I'm interested 
</I>&gt;<i> in (but maybe they're not where your interests are?). 
</I>&gt;<i> They're mainly around social lightweight collaboration:
</I>&gt;<i>      - bookclub, investment club
</I>&gt;<i>      - trip/travel planning
</I>&gt;<i>      - small research project e.g. family genealogy,
</I>&gt;<i>      - knowledge base for advocacy group: e.g. facts 
</I>&gt;<i> about broadcast flag, Sudan, etc.
</I>
I edited slide 4 and added &quot;stub&quot; entries for some of those examples.
There's room for more content on that page.  You can go in and flesh out the
stubs if you have OpenOffice, or if you send me the text I can make
additions.  


&gt;<i> Slide 6: another great slide! You may need to talk 
</I>&gt;<i> about concept of &quot;units&quot; since you have sq. km as 
</I>&gt;<i> an example.
</I>
Yup, I'm excited about adding support for units and properties.  That's a
feature I've been wanting for 10 or 15 years now!


&gt;<i> Slide 7: Wow, lots of useful info here. Small questions:
</I>&gt;<i>    - Items can be tagged by anyone, not just the creator
</I>&gt;<i> of the item, right? So, we should support queries to view
</I>&gt;<i> items tagged just by myself (or any single individual) 
</I>&gt;<i> and also queries to view items tagged by everybody (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> just like delicious)?
</I>
I feel like that's one of the big open issues with our &quot;virtuality&quot;.  I'm
very much drawn to the delicious &quot;bazaar&quot; style of collaboration, but maybe
the Wikipedia &quot;cathedral&quot; is a better fit for most of the domains we're
thinking about.  Or, maybe there's some easy way to have both &quot;bazaar&quot; and
&quot;cathedral&quot; usage-styles without making the UI too confusing. We should sit
down with Mimi some weekend and think about where we want to go with all
this. 


&gt;<i>      - After hearing Jimmy Wales talk, should we support 
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous writes?
</I>
Yup, maybe so.  I'd be curious to hear what discussion the Wikipedia folks
have had about potential problems with copyright infringement by allowing
anonymous writes.  That was one of my main concerns with anonymous writes,
but maybe it's a manageable problem.


&gt;<i> Slide 8: We want to state in the longer run, we will have 
</I>&gt;<i> support beyond Firefox, right? What about architecture to 
</I>&gt;<i> support OR in 3rd party sites? Do we want to talk about that?
</I>
I added IE and Safari to the slide.  If we have time on Thursday, it would
also be good to talk about OpenRecord embedded in 3rd party sites, but I
haven't added it to the slide yet because I couldn't figure out an easy way
to fit it in.  


&gt;<i> I think a slide about how we fit in, and position ourselves 
</I>&gt;<i> with/ against Wikipedia would be interesting and fruitful 
</I>&gt;<i> for discussion.  Also, I think Mitch is interested in 
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative decision making.  Doesn't need to be in the 
</I>&gt;<i> prep material, but I think it should be one focus in our 
</I>&gt;<i> discussions. I like the demo we discussed about how we  
</I>&gt;<i> can make decisions to be more fact-based and criteria-based.
</I>
Yup, agreed.  I still don't really have a demo &quot;script&quot; in mind, so that's
something we'll need to work out in the next few days.  It would be great if
we could figure out how to use our existing feature set to somehow show
promise toward collaborative decision making applications.  More
brainstorming for Monday!
