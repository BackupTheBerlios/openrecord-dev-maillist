<PRE>Hey Mignon,

On Monday we were talking about the problem of how to find the path to the
plugin directory in JavaScript code that might have been loaded either by a
unit test page or by an actual end-user page like tuscany.html.

You maybe have already solved that problem, but if you're still looking for
ideas, I had a couple thoughts...

Idea 1:
  Right now, all of our unit tests live in the &quot;tests&quot; directory.  But, we
could make an exception for unit tests that test the &quot;storage&quot; package.  We
could have those unit tests live in top level directory, along with the
end-user pages.  And then in the storage code we could just hard-code the
path from the top level directory to the plugin directory: something like
&quot;plugins/&quot;.  The path would be the same when you ran the unit tests as it is
when you load an end-user page.

Idea 2:
  This is a little bit complicated, but we could figure out the path to the
plugins directory based on information we already have from two sources:
&quot;window.location.pathname&quot; (wlp) and &quot;dojo.hostenv.getBaseScriptUri()&quot;
(bsu).  In the case of a unit test run from the &quot;tests/storage&quot; directory,
the results of window.location.pathname and getBaseScriptUri() will be:
  wlp == &quot;/C:/foo/bar/zig/OpenRecord/tests/storage/StorageTest.html&quot;
  bsu == &quot;../../third_party/dojo/dojo-rev1759/&quot;
In the case of an actual end-user page like tuscany.html, the results of
window.location.pathname and getBaseScriptUri() will be:
  wlp == &quot;/C:/foo/bar/zig/OpenRecord/open_agenda.html&quot;
  bsu == &quot;third_party/dojo/dojo-rev1759/&quot;

  So, it would take a little work, but you could strip off the &quot;___.html&quot;
file from the window.location.pathname value, and from the getBaseScriptUri
value you could strip off &quot;third_party&quot; and everything after it.  And then
you can append the modified window.location.pathname value and the modified
getBaseScriptUri value.  In the case of a unit test run from the
&quot;tests/storage&quot; directory you would get a URI like this:
  &quot;/C:/foo/bar/zig/OpenRecord/tests/storage/../../&quot;
In the case of an actual end-user page like tuscany.html, you would get a
URI like this:
  &quot;/C:/foo/bar/zig/OpenRecord/&quot;

I'm not sure that either of these are good ideas, but I thought I'd toss
them into the mix, on the chance that one of them seems useful to you.
