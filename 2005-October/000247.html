<PRE>Hi Rowan,

I'm glad to hear you made it safely back to Ireland.  Let me fill you in on
the OpenRecord news from the past couple months.  I'll cc this to the
openrecord-dev mailing list, as other people might be interested too.

-------------
Recent Coding
-------------
  Back during the summer we focused mainly on UI features, and on creating
demo documents for the demos we gave in August.  In September and October we
took a break from the UI code, and we've been focused on the underlying
infrastructure.  So, if you run the app, it should look exactly the same as
it did two months ago, but now there's a more solid foundation underneath.  

  We've made a bunch of incremental improvements in the past couple months:
added unit tests, improved the data model API, started work on an automatic
plugin loader, cleaned up the UUID code, etc.  None of that is too dramatic.
The one dramatic change is that we've adopted the Dojo Toolkit
(dojotoolkit.org).

  We did a big sweep to convert all our code to use the Dojo package system
and Dojo style namespaces.  Now we're incrementally adopting other Dojo
tools.  We've switched all the event registration code to use
dojo.event.connect, and we've started to replace our home-grown utility
functions with &quot;standard&quot; Dojo functions.  When we get around to it, we can
switch over to using Dojo for drag-and-drop, and for MD5 encryption, and for
cookie access, and then we can get rid of our dependencies on several third
party JavaScript packages (script.aculo.us, prototype.js, md5.js) and
hopefully end up with Dojo as our only dependency.

---------------
Upcoming Coding
---------------
  Now that the foundation code is in better shape, it's time to shift back
to adding new functionality.  We've got a to-do list file with about 70
detailed tasks on it, but here are the main things we need to do next,
roughly in priority order: 
 
(1) Create a real backend 
With our current transaction-log approach, page loads get sluggish for
repositories with over a few hundred items or a few thousand entries.   We
don't yet need an industrial strength backend, but it would be good to have
some intermediate solution that could handle thousands of items and hundreds
of thousands of entries.  

Mignon and Jason and Marty and I have been talking about design ideas for an
intermediate backend store.  I'll write something up about that ASAP.  Jason
has volunteered to work on the PHP for the proposed design, if we decide on
that approach.  Jason is away is China for the next two weeks, but he'll be
available after that.
 
(2) Start writing plugin views
Finish up the new data model API and plugin system, and write up some
documentation and example plugins.  Invite lots of friends to start writing
experimental plugin views: Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, Gantt Chart, FAQ View,
Thumbnail View, Version History View, etc.

(3) Stabilize the file format
Clean up a few little things about how we represent Dates and Ordinals and
whatnot in our file format, and get to a point where we'll promise backward
compatibility: &quot;Items that you save using OpenRecord 0.2 will not be lost
when we upgrade to OpenRecord 0.3.&quot;

(4) Make a UI for new users
Think carefully about the basic UI.  Design and implement a UI that works
well for new users.  Figure out how to make everything intuitive for
somebody who is setting up their very first repository and creating their
first few items.  Back in August, Mimi volunteered to help us with this UI
design work.  We weren't ready then, but hopefully she'll still be available
when we are.

(5) Work on interoperation
Look into what it would take to be able to embed OpenRecord views inside
MediaWiki pages.  Work on import/export tools for interoperation with things
like googlebase.com.

(6) Stabilize the URL format
Get to a point where we promise backward compatibility for URLs: &quot;Bookmarks
that you make to OpenRecord 0.2 pages will continue to work when we upgrade
to OpenRecord 0.3.&quot;

(7) Do ongoing Dojoification
Continue to replace our home-grown utility functions with Dojo utilities,
and replace other third-party dependencies with Dojo modules.  Look into
replacing our notion of Views with Dojo's notion of Widgets.

(8) Port to IE
Make OpenRecord run in IE, not just Firefox.  Figure out how to do automated
unit tests for the UI code.

---------------
Legal structure
---------------
  We have ten people on the openrecord-dev mailing list, and we've had a
dozen or so people who've attended design meetings or reviewed parts of the
design and offered feedback.  We have a number of people who've expressed
interest in writing code, but so far we've only had three people coding.  

  We've been slow to get more programmers involved, partly because we
weren't really ready until now -- we've had a fairly small code base, with
APIs that were in flux, and I was worried about getting too many of us
bumping into each other.  Now that we've got a more settled structure, I'm
eager to get more people involved.  
 
  In order to accept contributions from lots of people, we need some legal
structure for handling contributor license agreements, both from individuals
and potentially also from their employers.  For several months now we've
been looking into different options.  We could have started our own new
Software Foundation, but that would have taken lots of time and money.  Or
we could have used some sort of peer-to-peer license agreement, but that
would have been risky and brittle.  It seemed clear that the best thing to
do was to become a project of an existing open source foundation.

  I talked with people at a few different open source foundations, and the
Dojo Foundation looked like the best fit for us.  I've been following up
with them about running the OpenRecord project under the auspices of the
Dojo Foundation, so that we'll be sheltered under their legal umbrella.
They still need to vote on it, but I think they'll vote yes, so probably in
another week we'll be a Dojo project.  They said we can go ahead and send in
our Dojo contributor license agreements (CLAs) now.  The Dojo CLA is a clone
of the Apache one, so it's a standard, widely used CLA.  Have a look at it,
and if you're okay with it, you can print it and sign it
&lt;<A HREF="http://dojotoolkit.org/icla.txt">http://dojotoolkit.org/icla.txt</A>&gt;.  Please mail it to me instead of to the
Dojo address; I'll collect all of our CLAs and them send them in one bundle
to Dojo.  Here's my address:
  Brian Skinner
  2043 Ninth Avenue
  San Francisco, CA 94116-1302
  USA

  I'm excited about being affiliated with Dojo.  They're doing great work
and I think they have a lot of momentum and are likely to really take off.
It looks like we'll be able to ship OpenRecord under a dual license, so that
we can continue to make the OpenRecord code available under the terms of the
Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication that we've been using, as well
having it under the terms of the Academic Free License used by the rest of
the Dojo code.  Hopefully we'll also be able to contribute some of the
OpenRecord utility classes into the main Dojo release.

-------------
Collaboration
-------------
  In the past couple months, I've approached both Socialtext and Jotspot
about the idea of collaborating with one of them.  I think both those
companies are interested in features for working with structured content on
a wiki.  I'd love to make OpenRecord interoperate with one of their tools,
so that our users could exchange content smoothly.  

  Or, better still, I'd love to do some sort of joint development project,
so that we worked together on a single code base.  The OpenRecord project
could ship the code as a free open source app that users install and
administer themselves.  Socialtext or Jotspot could add additional
proprietary enterprise features, and ship a fully supported commercial
version as a hosted service.  I don't know whether that's a realistic
scenario, but neither company has yet said &quot;no&quot;, so something might come of
it.  I'll keep you posted if anything develops.

  Another option is to collaborate with the MediaWiki developers.  They're
interested in adding structured-content features to MediaWiki, and they've
started working on a &quot;Wikidata&quot; project for that
&lt;<A HREF="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata</A>&gt;.  Plus there are other projects we
might want to look at more closely, like the SemperWiki project
&lt;<A HREF="http://m3pe.org/semperwiki/">http://m3pe.org/semperwiki/</A>&gt; and googlebase (when it ships).  

------------------
OpenRecord Retreat
------------------
  In mid-November we're having a week-long programming retreat where we're
going to work on the OpenRecord code.  We've renting a big cabin a couple
hours north of San Francisco, and we're going to hunker down and code for a
week.  Mignon and Chao and I will be there, as well as few other people who
will be working on other projects but may have some time to contribute to
OpenRecord.  


Okay, that's all the news I can think of.  I'll get to work on a write up
about backend ideas, and then hopefully this weekend do a check in of the
code with the new data model API!

Cheers,
  Brian
