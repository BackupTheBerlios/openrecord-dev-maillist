Subject: [openrecord-dev] existing user/login API
Message-ID: <200505040225.j442PPm22353@bat.berlios.de>

Hey Chao,

Here's the API that the new data model offers for creating users/accounts
and logging in (see below).  

You can also look at the data model unit tests, to see some examples of code
that creates new users and logs them in and out:
http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openrecord/trunk/source/model/ModelTest.js?vie
w=markup

The new data model already has a working implementation of this API,
although we can always refactor the API and implementation if this turns out
to be the wrong design.

Good luck!

Chao,

After your last two updates of TablePlugin.js, how is a user supposed 
to add a new row to a table?  As of version 56, a new row appeared 
automatically in edit mode, but as of version 58, it doesn't.  I 
haven't yet figured out a way to compare two files on my iBook other 
than unix diff, so about all I can see is that there was a very large 
amount of code changed....

Hi Mignon,

Sorry, you can't add a new row to a table at this time. To get the  
sorting code in, I had to first refactor TablePlugin to be DOM  
Level-2 style. I removed the functionality to add a new row as part  
of that effort, because 1) sorting made it such that the "last row"  
wasn't necessarily the newly added row 2) there's were bugs in the  
old code anyway.

I was hoping to wait till Brian gets back to discuss how to add the  
"add new row" functionality back. But now I see that you may be  
relying on that functionality (sorry!). If you are, I can try to add  
the functionality back in a maybe hacky way.

I'd like to throw up a suggestion for creating new rows, and perhaps  
more generally creating new items.

The problem is that I'd like each table cell to correspond to a  
specific item's attribute entry, the table cell then knows how to  
persist itself. This works pretty well now, except of course for the  
creation of new items. Some problems are:
     1) You need to create a new blank item every time a table is  
being edited
     2) You don't really want to save the blank item if it's really  
blank (what it does now)
     3) You don't want the blank item to be part of the sort list

What I think I'll like (but not completely crystallized) is an Item  
template or proxy. It acts like an item in most ways, when it is  
being queried in a read-only way, responding as an item would through  
the item API. However, it is not instantiated in the repository. Only  
when it is actually written (i.e. when it acquires a value or  
attribute), then it becomes a full-fledge Item object with a  
representation in the repository.

Does this make sense? Is it do-able in our repository? I think it's  
do-able in Javascript since it's a reasonably typeless language.

Thanks,
chao

Hey Chao,

I read through all the new TablePlugin code.  Nice work.  It looks so much
better without all the cell delegates and cell ids and other cruft.  And
it's cool that the TextView class was flexible enough to that you could use
it in the TablePlugin after only a handful of changes.

The table-sorting UI feels great -- simple and snappy.  There are a couple
new bugs now with the arrow keys.  I think they might just be off-by-one
errors.  We can look at them this afternoon.  The new code no longer passes
all the unit tests, but that should be really easy to fix too.  Actually,
the unit test lint tests may be overly restrictive.  Maybe this afternoon we
can talk about that, and about relaxing the coding conventions in other
ways, if that makes sense.

Hi Brian,

Thanks, I think I fixed the arrow key bug (or at least one of them) -  
I was calculating the number of columns in the table incorrectly.  
Also added a few comments to the private functions in TablePlugin.

Embarrassed to say I finally figured out how to add SVN log comments  
through my client.

Hey Chao,

I switched all our code over to use the new data model, and everything seems
to work fine!

I wired up your sign-in/sign-out code so that it calls the login/logout
methods that the new data model offers.  I did a quick-and-dirty job of
that, so we'll probably want to revisit it at some point.  Next time we meet
up I can explain what I did and what I didn't do, and we can talk about how
we really want it to work.  

The data model now supports password-checking authentication, so we can add
UI for that whenever we want to.  The password storage isn't yet the least
bit secure, but I figured it was a step in the right direction to at least
have a functional API for authentication.

I also added a new method to the data model, so that a view can create a
"provisional item".  I new provisional items are intended to meet the need
for creating "blank items" or "template items" when the user is entering a
brand new row in a table.

Hey Chao,

I made a method called "newProvisionalItem()", which creates a new item that
can be used in a new blank row at the bottom of a table:

  var newItem = world.newProvisionalItem();

The "provisional items" should work just the way you described in your
proposal.  Let me know what you think of the name.  We can change it if
something else would be better: newBlankItem(), newTemplateItem(), etc. 

I tested it some, but not as much as I would have liked to, because we're
not yet really set up to test actions that make changes in the saved
repository.  We can talk more about that sometime when we're looking at our
unit tests.

That's a great page.  I think we should do a number of things just like
that.

I added one new task to our to-do list, about letting the user press the
Escape key when editing.

I think it would be good if we gave the user visual cues about what fields
are editable.  Actually, our code used to do a better job of that, back in
April.  Try going to our old April demo page:
  http://openrecord.org/demo/current/trunk/source/demo_page.html

If you press the "Edit" button, then you see bordered "edit boxes" whenever
you hover the mouse over the text fields.  Our current code doesn't give
visual cues until you actually click on the text.  Is that something we
should fix before 0.1?

Message-ID: <200505192330.j4JNUsm20479@bat.berlios.de>

Just following up from our conversation on Monday about JSLint and the ++
operator...

Happily, JSLint only complains about postfix operations, not prefix
operations: i++ and i--, not ++i and --i.

Here's what Douglas Crockford has to say about why he considers i++ to be
dangerous:
  "The ++ (post-increment) and -- (post-decrement) operators have been known
to contribute to bad code by encouraging excessive trickiness. They are
second only to faulty architecture in enabling to viruses and other security
menaces. JSLint does not expect to see them by default. JSLint currently
tolerates the pre-increment and pre-decrement forms."

If you're interested, here's the complete list of things JSLint checks for,
and the rational behind the checks:

You're right, the mouseover behavior has changed with the hovering.

I would prefer to have a UI design and CSS architecture melding  
before fixing it, as I see this as part of getting CSS done right?  
I'm much more fixated on the shrinking and expanding textedit box,  
'tho :(, as that's just plain wrong regardless of what UI design we  
choose.

Thanks for the links Chao!

Wow, that TiddlyWiki thing is doing something very interesting.  I had seen
TiddlyWiki before, but I hadn't bothered to spend more than a few minutes
looking at it.  This time I spent a little more time, and I'm very glad I
did.

TiddlyWiki is designed to run on your local machine, running from a
"file://" URL rather than an "http://" URL, so that you don't have to have
Apache running on your local machine.  

Whenever you make a change to a wiki entry, the TiddlyWiki JavaScript code
saves your new data file to the local file system.  I actually had thought
that was impossible.  I thought JavaScript had no mechanism for saving data
to a file on the local machine.  

Sometime when we have time, it'd be great to study the TiddlyWiki code that
does local saves, and understand the mechanism they're using.  It involves a
bunch of JavaScript components I know nothing about: the "netscape" object's
security PrivilegeManager, and UniversalXPConnect, and
Components.interfaces.nsILocalFile and
Components.interfaces.nsIFileOutputStream.  Looks like it might all be a
little brittle, but it'd be wonderful if OpenRecord could support the
entirely new use case of having someone run OpenRecord on their home machine
to manage personal data!

Yup, the shrinking and expanding is just plain wrong.  But I'm reluctant to
fix that right now...  

We still haven't thought much about what sort of UI components we want to
have within each table cell.  I think in the long run we're going to want to
have a UI that lets people add more than one entry into a table cell, and a
UI for selecting entries, deleting entries, reordering entries, etc.  Also a
UI for doing data type validation, and a UI for auto completion as you're
typing.  And a UI for entering references to other items by selecting them
from pull-down lists, or via drag-and-drop.  

All of which means that code for what's going on within a table cell is
likely to change a great deal in next few months, so it might not be worth
spending much time debugging the visual glitch in the current code.

Message-ID: <200505231722.j4NHMOm06310@bat.berlios.de>

Here's an interesting tidbit from Ted Leung's weblog...

It's a quote from Linus Torvalds about a data model architectural issue in a
collaborative content management tool:

 "I argued with Larry about it, but Larry (correctly, I 
  believe) argued that efficient and reliable distribution 
  really requires the concept of "history is immutable". 
  It makes replication much easier when you know that the 
  known subset _never_ shrinks or changes - you only add 
  on top of it."

That's part of what I had in mind in designing our OpenRecord data model to
have immutable history as fundamental feature.  It feels validating to find
a supporting quote from Linus!

Here's the full entry on Ted Leung's weblog.  The Linus Torvalds quote goes
on to talk about the group dynamics of on-line collaboration, and the value
of designing your tools to support a "arbitrary network" of people rather
than a "hierarchy" of collaborators:

I did a little more work today on the login UI.  While I was at it I created
user accounts for all of us, in the demo repository.  

If you check out the latest release and open demo_page.html, you should be
able to log in without having to create a new account first.  I didn't make
passwords, so just leave the password field blank.  You can add a password
if you want to.  We don't yet have a UI for changing your password, but you
can edit the user list file in the repository and then check in your
changes.

Hey Chao and Mignon,

Monday (May 30).  Does that still sound good, like at 1:00 or 1:15 at
Chao's?

Message-ID: <200505271802.j4RI2pm24349@bat.berlios.de>

Hey Chao,

I just checked in a new version of OpenRecord that saves the user passwords
as encrypted md5 hashes instead of clear-text passwords.  

Surprisingly, it only took about 20 minutes to add that feature, including
writing a few unit tests for the md5 code.  It's funny what ends up being
hard and what ends up being easy!

Hi Brian and Mignon,

Sorry for the late notice but do you mind if we move it to Weds or

Since it's memorial day, Elaine wanted to do something.

That works for me too.  Let's plan on meeting Monday (June 6) at Chao's at
1:00.

That'll be the first Monday in June.  A month ago, on the first Monday in
May, was the meeting where we did the release planning for 0.1 and talked
about what tasks to do in the first iteration.  We talked about maybe having
1-month iterations.  

How about we say that the meeting on Monday June 6 will mark the end of the
first iteration and the start of the second iteration?  We can measure our
observed velocity for iteration 1, and make estimates for the iteration 2
tasks.

Hi Brian,

I tested the modeltest TestSuite over on my Windows PC, with the  
pages serving off my mac's apache server, and everything ran fine.  
So, I suspect it's a mac vs. pc firefox issue.

I'm going to checkin my code because I think the bug is likely to be  
already present on the mac.

As far as I can tell, the bug on the mac is that there are two  
entries created for the "Name" attribute on an item. The two entries  
point to the same identical item.

Anyway, maybe you can help figure it out with Mignon Sunday? I'm also  
available tomorrow (sat).

Thanks,

Hey Chao,

This seems like a really weird bug.  I'm a little bit baffled about what
might be causing it.  And, unfortunately, I don't own a Mac, so I don't have
any good way to reproduce it.  But, I did have a couple thoughts...  

I'm kind of grasping at straws here, but one thing you could do is to try
loading  TestSuite.html from a file:/// prefix rather than an
http://localhost: prefix.  That tends tease out potential problems that
result from Apache caching some files. 

My only other thought is that there's maybe some connection between this bug
and all the new UUID code that I just checked in.  The UUIDs seem to work
fine in Firefox on Windows, but maybe the Mac Firefox implementation has
some slightly different implementation of the Core JavaScript functions --
Number, Math.random(), etc. 

I'll be available by phone on Saturday, and then on Sunday Mignon and I can
look at the code and maybe debug it on a Mac and PC side by side.

:o) Brian

OK, all the test suites now work on my mac ?!

I tried using file:/// as you suggested and that worked, and then I  
went back to http://localhost and that worked too.

Either I was in an alternate reality yesterday or there's some weird  
Apache caching going on or that I'm clueless in some other way :(

Cool, that's excellent news.  Sounds like there wasn't really a bug in our
code after all, and I'm excited about having one less bug to debug!

My guess is that there's some weird Apache caching going on.  Mignon and I
ran into some weird glitches too, earlier this month.  I forget exactly what
happened, but I think that everything got better when we just shut down
Apache and re-started it.  It might be worth investing some time in figuring
out if there are ways to configure Apache so that it never caches anything.
That, or getting in the habit of re-starting Apache at the first sign of
trouble!

Wonderful!  Thanks!  I just checked out all the new code and tried it out.
The new row entry stuff works perfectly and looks great!  And I like the
experimental auto-completion UI in the table cells.  We'll have to figure
out answers to all the UI question you raised about the auto-completion, but
auto-completion definitely feels like the right direction to be moving in. 

This is all really exciting.  I feel like the app is starting to come
together.  I'm eager to see where we'll be a month from now!

Hey Chao,

Thanks for re-sending the message -- the original message didn't ever
arrive. There must have been some problem with the berlios mail server -- I
also didn't ever get a copy of the automatic message that subversion should
have sent out when you did the check in.

Hey Chao, 

Yup, I've been doing everything only on a brand new desktop PC, which has
maybe really been insulating me from the performance issues.  

I just did a few timing tests...  On my PC, it takes just 10 seconds to run
the *entire* suite of unit tests, including all the lint tests
(.../trunk/source/TestSuite.html).

I'd be curious to see how that number compares to the different machines
that you and Mignon are using.  It'd be good to get a sense of just how wide
the gap is between our different machines.  And then we should start talking
about what we need to do differently... maybe start taking performance
tuning more seriously? ... or take the lint tests out of the main test
suite? ... or get faster machines to do development on ;-)

:o) Brian

Hi Brian,

I'm done with my checkins. I added new row support for tables. I also  
have an experimental version of utilizing your cool SuggestionBox  
class in TextView for Tables. I decided to create a separate class  
for now just to get things going. There are numerous UI fixes still  
to be made, so if you find it annoying, you can comment out this  
experimental feature at:

TablePlugin: Line 318

A few more questions/comments for discussion after working on the code:
1) Should there be a Query class? Maybe also Attribute?
2) Should we create a Plugin base abstract class? I think this will  
be helpful, and will help refactoring all the other plugins to not  
depend on SectionView.getListOfContentItems()
3) We need to discuss the usage and UI for Auto Completion (i.e.  
SuggestionBox):
     - we need to add arrow key and tab/return support
         - implementation issue: what's the easiest way to implement  
selection of SuggestionBox item?
     - should only certain attributes do "Auto Completion" by default  
and not others? if so, what criteria do we use to decide?
     - when doing auto-completion for attributes, should we can  
through all entries for this attribute? or just all entries within a  
certain context e.g. all entries for attribute X in Table Y?

4) In model/StubVirtualServer.js Line 193, I'm making a call to a  
protected method, can you see what's the best way to fix this problem?

5) How do you do Util.assert(x != null)? Util.assert(x) doesn't pass  
the LintTest

6) Should we consider not supporting "strict line ending" in the  
LintTest? the ";" at the end of prototype functions is really getting  
to me.

Happy pair programming tomorrow!

Thanks,
chao

Hi Mimi,

It was great getting your UI advice Thurs evening.

If you're interested, you should sign up on the mailing list for open  
record:
http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openrecord-svn

I wrote up some UI issues about auto-completion here:
http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openrecord-dev/2005-May/000077.html

You can also try out a recent build at:
http://coolchaser.com/openrecord/demo_page.html

Try out the 1) account login/creation 2) table editing/sorting/auto  
completion to get the sense of UI help we'll need.

Have fun,
chao

Actually, that's the list that just has all the source code check-ins.  The
interesting list is the dev discussion list:

Two more issues to bring up:

1) We should think about conventions or patterns on separating blocks  
of view set up code from data model code which could have view  
observers that call possibly interfering view code. This bit me a few  
times when implementing the "add new row" feature.

e.g. when a TextView stopEditing() is called, it replaces the  
editField with a text node, and writes out the new value to the  
repository. If the latter is done first, an observer could be called,  
say on the enclosing TablePlugin to add a new row (if the edited item  
is a provisional item). Adding a new row, causes onblur to be called  
on the TextView, which calls stopEditing() again!
There are definitely ways to prevent this from happening, but I think  
having conventions would make such issues less prevalent.

2) We should think about a convention to prevent malicious Javascript/ 
HTML code from executing as user input as Joel describes in the  
article below that Brian that Brian sent out.
