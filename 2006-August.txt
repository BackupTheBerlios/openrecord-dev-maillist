Subject: [openrecord-dev] openrecord SVN move
Message-ID: <44DC1BBF.5040207@dojotoolkit.org>

Important news for anybody who is working with the OpenRecord source code:

We just finished moving our SVN repository.  We are no longer using our 
old repository at BerliOS.  Thanks to Dustin at the Dojo Foundation, we 
now have a new SVN repository set up at dojotoolkit.org, available via 
anonymous SVN at:
   http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/openrecord/trunk

I've updated our web site so that the developer info page has links to 
the new repository:
   http://openrecord.org/dev.html

The old BerliOS repository still exists, but we will no longer be 
checking code in there.  From now on we'll only be committing changes to 
the new repository.

If you want the latest code, you should do a checkout from the new 
repository.  The new repository has Hiran's new Pivot Table plugin, as 
well as the most recent versions of the Bar Chart and Scatter Plot plugins.

We used to have an openrecord-svn mailing list at BerliOS, which you 
could subscribe to if you wanted to get automatically generated messages 
that were sent by the Subversion repository when developers made changes 
to the source code.  That mailing list still exists, with the archives 
intact, but there will never again be any traffic on it.

We don't yet have a replacement mailing list wired up to the new SVN 
repository at dojotoolkit.org.  Dustin should have that set up for us 
within a few weeks.

In the next couple months we'll be gradually moving the rest of the 
OpenRecord infrastructure over to the Dojo Foundation servers at 
dojotoolkit.org.  We're planning to set up a couple new tools for the 
OpenRecord project: a new Trac site (for bugs and feature requests), and 
a new wiki (for ideas, documentation, notes, etc.).  We'll also 
eventually replace this mailing list, openrecord-dev at berlios.de, with a 
corresponding list at dojotoolkit.org.

BerliOS has been a great home for the project this past year.  I'm 
extremely grateful to all the people who keep BerliOS running, and who 
have provided quality service for us completely free of charge.  Back 
when OpenRecord became a project of the Dojo Foundation we started 
talking about moving the OpenRecord infrastructure over onto Dojo 
servers.  It's great to be part of Dojo, and I'm psyched about the move.

the new version of their product (4.0).

You can browser the source here:

Cool.  Thanks for the heads-up about that.

The contrast in the legalese behind those two links is amusing.  The 
code itself is posted publicly on the web and licensed under a friendly 
open source license, yet the hosted demo is only available under a 
gnarly "Evaluation Agreement" that talks about "Confidential Pre-release 
Software" and requires you to agree not to "attempt to discover any 
source code or underlying ideas" in the software.

The zimbra install is rather aggressive. If you've got mysql running, 
you have to shut it off. At least the wintel installer installs 
everything. But, it comes down with the mpl license. No problems 
there.It appears to be really cool. I have yet to boot it. Got too many 
other projects using mysql for the time being.

Subject: [openrecord-dev] svn:externals for Timeline code?
Message-ID: <44E3F6E7.8020905@dojotoolkit.org>

Hey Hiran, Mignon, and anyone else who might have advice on this,

I've been thinking about the new SIMILE Timeline code that we just added 
to the "third_party" directory in our SVN repository.  Right now, the 
Timeline code in our SVN repository is a copy of the code from the 
SIMILE project SVN repository.  Alternatively, we could add an 
"svn:externals" property to our "third_party" directory, to include the 
Timeline code "by reference" instead of "by copy".  (More info about 
svn:externals here: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch07s03.html )

We're already using an "svn:externals" property setting to include the 
dojo source tree in our OpenRecord "third_party" directory.  Using 
"svn:externals" has the advantages that, (a) it makes it really easy to 
periodically upgrade to the current version of the third-party code, and 
(b) it discourages us (prevents us) from making any modifications to the 
code in the third-party directory.  The disadvantage is that it creates 
a dependency on the SVN server of the third-party project.  There isn't 
much practical downside to OpenRecord having a dependency on the SVN 
repository of the Dojo Toolkit, since both the Dojo Toolkit SVN 
repository and OpenRecord SVN repository are on the same server, 
administered by the same person.  But is it a mistake to introduce a 
dependency on the SIMILE SVN server, which could be intermittently down, 
or might someday move to a new address (or go away)?

I'm inclined to use the "svn:externals" property for the SIMILE Timeline 
code instead of having a copy in our repository, but I feel like I'm 
just guessing about this, and I was hoping somebody else might have 
advice to offer.

Also, is there a better name for the "third_party" directory?  I figure 
this sort of directory must be common in software projects -- anybody 
know of a standard name for it?

I would think using the svn external would be a good thing.  Since you 
can specify the revision that you want checkout, its just quite nice :) 
  However, I had difficulties on some occasions.  I think you can only 
have one extern in any particular directory, so we'll need to test that 
or see if there is some directory structure that eliminates this 
wierdness.  I could of course just be misinterpreting the information 
i've read about it...the docs on externals seems to be somewhat lacking 
to me, but thats how it goes.

I think maybe you can only have one svn:externals *property* in a 
particular directory, but I think the value of the svn:externals 
property can include a newline-separated list of different external 
modules.

Very thoughtful post. Question (reflecting ignorance of svn): does an 
external reference imply that doing an svn update on your repository 
will cause an update from the third party repository automatically?
Thanks

Message-ID: <44EA74A8.3040000@dojotoolkit.org>

For those of you who are interested in the finer points of open source 
licensing...

When I started OpenRecord, back in 2005, I started it as a public domain 
project, using a public domain dedication (PDD) instead of an open 
source license.  My goal was to distribute the code with no 
restrictions, so that anyone could take all of the code, or any small 
part of it, and use it for any purpose.  When we became a project of the 
Dojo Foundation, we agreed to also distribute the code under the 
Academic Free License (AFL), the standard license used by all Dojo 
Foundation projects.

Since then, I've been gradually learning more about public domain 
dedications -- reading FAQs, talking with attorneys, and corresponding 
with other open source developers.  It's become increasingly clear that 
using the PDD is problematic.  It's also problematic to try to use the 
PDD in conjunction with the AFL.  Last week our own attorney gave me her 
advice on the matter, confirming what I had heard elsewhere.  If you're 
interested in the gnarly details, let me know, and I can post a quick 
summary about why the PDD is problematic.

Based on the advice we've gotten, I believe we should stop running 
OpenRecord as a public domain project, and instead simply distribute the 
OpenRecord code using the AFL, a conventional open source license.  We 
might also consider dual-licensing under both the AFL and the BSD 
License, as the Dojo Toolkit does.  I'm planning to raise this issue 
over on the dojo-contributors mailing list, where we can have a vote of 
the dojo committers and (hopefully) get approval for the change.

If the dojo committers approve of change, then the old code in our SVN 
repository would continue to be in the public domain (up to revision N), 
but revision N+1 would be a derivative work that would be licensed under 
the AFL (and perhaps BSD) but would not be placed in the public domain.

In addition to placing the OpenRecord source code in the public domain, 
we've also been placing all the ancillary material in the public domain: 
the screencasts, the web site, the posts to the mailing list, etc.  At 
some point we might want to revisit that decision, but the PDD is not as 
problematic for those uses as it was for the source code, so for now I 
think it's fine to keep using the PDD for that content.

Brian, I would like to learn, why public domain  is problematic for 
software projects.

I thought up to now, that Python, is published as "public domain".
But I looked closer 
(http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.2/license/)  and in fact,
python is not distributed as public domain but with a license, giving 
you most of the
benefits of public domain

    '' GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.''
   
but still is a license which forces you

- to keep the copyright info in it
- to accept the software "as it is"


Publishing software as PD gives you no license at all, but software 
developers
and publishers need at least be protected from possible infringements.

Is this the point ?

I share this letter with the "working in parallel" mailinglist of
minciu sodas (http://www.ms.lt/) and hope you feel comfortable with that.

What is esactly the difference between a public domain dedication (PDD)
and an  Academic Free License (AFL)?
Can the AFL be used in commercial software? It is like an LGPL?
Stornger? Weaker?

The AFL is a BSD-like Open Source License which uses copyright law to 
provide a set of guarantees to users about how they can use the code 
based on the fact that a license agreement has been offered and 
accepted.

The Public Domain, OTOH, attempts to divest the original owner of any 
rights to enforce any agreement whatsoever by disclaiming any ongoing 
interest in the code.

What the Foundation's lawyers determined is that we can't both say "if 
you hurt yourself with this software, we can't be liable" and "we 
divest all interest in the copyrights to this code" at the same time. 
Since liability disclaimers are a big part of Open Source software, the 
public domain won't really meet our goals (i.e., we're not getting paid 
enough to care about whether or not your hurt yourself with our code).

> Can the AFL be used in commercial software?

Yes. It's explicitly sub-licenseable.

> It is like an LGPL? 

It's more BSD-ish, but includes a weak patent termination clause. 
Essentially, you retain your right to use us for patent infringement in 
our software, but if you do, you can no longer use it under the terms 
of the AFL. You can *try* to screw us over, but we're under no 
obligation to help you out should you try.

> Stornger? Weaker?

More liberal. Depending on your politics, that could be viewed as either 
stronger or weaker ;-)

In countries like the United States and India it is possible to place 
software in the public domain.  In these countries there is a statutory 
framework for donating software to the public domain.  However, there 
are a number of problems...

(A) Moral rights problems

In some jurisdictions, including Germany, it is impossible for an author 
to place a work completely in the public domain.  An author cannot 
entirely relinquish copyright because the author automatically retains 
"moral rights."

(B) Liability problems

Placing software in the public domain is risky for the author because 
the author may retain a "warranty obligation".  The author may be held 
liable for flaws in the software, or for a user's mis-use of the 
software.  In the US there is no statutory mechanism for placing 
software in the public domain without incurring a risk of liability.  In 
contrast, by using an open source license, the license can explicitly 
disclaim warranties.

(C) Retraction problems

When an author places a work in the public domain, that may be 
considered to be a gift, rather than a legal agreement.  That gift may 
be an "illusory and unenforceable promise" that could be retracted by 
the author at any time.  Users might refrain from using the software out 
of fear that the public domain dedication and may someday be retracted.

(D) OSI certification problems

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) allows you to label your software as 
"OSI Certified Open Source Software" if the software is distributed 
using an open source license that has been approved by the OSI.  The OSI 
has approved about 60 open source licenses, including common licenses 
like the GPL, LGPL, AFL, BSD, MIT, Apache, Mozilla, etc.

In the 1990s, the OSI explicitly included public domain software as "OSI 
Certified Open Source Software", but in 2001 the OSI changed that 
policy, and now public domain software is not approved as OSI certified. 
  That lack of certification creates practical problems.  For example, 
every year Google provides millions of dollars of open source funding 
through their "Summer of Code" program, but Google will only fund 
projects where the code is released under an OSI approved license.

(E) Dual-release problems

It is common for open source projects to "dual-license" their software, 
making the software available under more than one open source license. 
That allows the user to choose the license that best meets their needs.

Even though the OSI does not certify public domain software, it would 
still be possible to get OSI certification if the software could be 
released using both an OSI certified license and a public domain 
dedication.  Unfortunately, a dual-release strategy will not work.  A 
dual-release is considered contradictory, because the author is 
necessarily asserting copyright rights by using an open source license, 
while at the same time using a public domain dedication that asserts 
that no one holds the copyright to the software.

Hi Brian,

If the Public Domain License may lead to problems, I think it is better to
go for AFL and BSD since the fundamental objectives of the project will not
be changed with the new agreements.

Cheers,
Hiran

Yup, I raised the issue on the dojo-contributors mailing list yesterday, 
and called for a vote:
http://dojotoolkit.org/pipermail/dojo-contributors/2006-August/003616.html

Voting will close tomorrow.  So far there has been no objection to the 
proposed change (12 votes in favor, 0 opposed).

Voting has closed, and the measure passed.  The final tally was 12 in 
favor and 0 against, out of about 38 eligible voters.

A couple of question on the developmenet version.
+Thsi version is still firefox-only-usable?
+When do you plan a new public release?
The current demo release is an year old, and it can be userful to
publish another version in
 http://www.openrecord.org/demo.html
to attract more people on it.

Hi Giovanni,

Yes, OpenRecord still only runs in Firefox.  It would be great see 
OpenRecord running in IE and other browsers, but that won't happen in 
2006 unless someone volunteers to work on it or we get some funding for it.

A lot of people have been asking us to post a new demo.  It's 
embarrassing that the old demo is now a year out of date, and we're 
eager to post a new one.  That's a priority now, and Mignon is working 
on it.  We still have some issues to sort out before we can post a demo, 
so it won't happen next week, but it should be up in September.
