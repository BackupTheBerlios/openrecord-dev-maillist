<PRE>Hi Brian,

</I>

Have you looked into the 'named graph' or quad support some of the RDF
stores have added? Sesame 2 is very nice, although still in alpha, and now
supports context. It also has an HTTP api, and supports the new W3C rdf
query language, SPARQL, for extracting subgraphs. I agree reification can
get messy quickly, depending on how you use it - although indexing
strategies can get around some headaches.

You may also want to take a look at C-Store - which has some similarities to
Google's BigTable work. It's a column store open source implementation.

What I am more critical of with triplestores is the scaling issues, and data
management issues. By data management issues, I mean Daisy has a nice
division in the form of 'parts' that allows you to store a typed blob and
attach a bunch of key/values to it (i.e. creating a 'document'). You can
always dereference a bunch of blobs via URIs referenced from an RDF store,
but there isn't an established API for this in any of the rdf stores - you
would have to setup your own blobstore and extend the query api's, and end
up rolling something similar to daisy, I imagine. Then there is ACL's, etc.
and other niceties that are not supported by most of the RDF stores. Daisy
abstracts many of these issues nicely in their HTTP APIs. That having been
said, I often find myself split down the middle to dump daisy for an RDF
store, as I watch daisy evolve more extensions to their own query language,
etc.. But theoretically, most anything can be layered on a triple/quad -
it's just that the implemantations still have a ways to go.

One other weakness, that is probably easily fixed, is that XML is the only
return type for the Daisy api - JSON would be nice.

I think we agree there are no ideal solutions at the moment, which is how I
stumbled on to your list.:-) Incidentally, I am working with life sciences
data - if the email didn't give that away.

I've also been playing with Daisy for a while now, and would be happy to
answer any questions - if I am able. Otherwise, the developers are always
very helpful on the mailing list, and pretty open to discussion of
extensions.

&gt;<i> daisy also mentioned, seems like a nice model with a ReST api.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Daisy CMS seems cool.  I don't know much about it, but there are a
</I>&gt;<i> bunch of sweet features that seem like they would be useful for
</I>&gt;<i> OpenRecord: the ReST API, multi-valued fields, versioning, language
</I>&gt;<i> variants, retired documents, transclusion, embedded queries, fields
</I>&gt;<i> shared across different document types, unique IDs instead of
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchical directory paths.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, in other ways Daisy doesn't seem like a fit for the OpenRecord data
</I>&gt;<i> model.  For OpenRecord, I think the biggest problems are that in Daisy:
</I>&gt;<i>   - fields can hold literal values, but I can't find any documentation
</I>&gt;<i> about fields being able to hold pointers to other documents
</I>

I think this is possible now -  if I understood your request correctly. I'm
not sure if it was 1.4 or 1.5 (this is the current Trunk version, and what I
am currently working with).

from one of the developer's posts on the mailing list:
&quot;A link field is a field which links to another document (or documents, in
case of multivalue fields). This allows for structured linking between
documents.&quot;

much less
&gt;<i> automatic bi-directional connections
</I>

 By &quot;automatic bi-directional connections&quot; do you mean &quot;inverse properties&quot;?
In RDF world, this would look like Car:hasName:CoolCar &lt;--&gt;
CoolCar:isNameof:Car

Also interesting about Daisy, you can define a query to populate a
SelectionList now - something I had been waiting for - this is from the new
linktype support mentioned above. And defining ACL's using queries is also
nice.

  - a document must belong to a document type, can only belong to one
&gt;<i> document type,
</I>

Yes, these are assumptions in the Daisy model - and have led me to consider
rolling my own solution. I've been able to fit most of my current use into
these assumptions though. But there has to be some organizing unit by which
you create versions off of, no? Perhaps you can comment on your thinking for
this..

and can only have the fields that are defined for its
&gt;<i> document type
</I>

Actually you can always extend the fields associated with a document type -
I do this all the time. Maybe I am misunderstanding your question though.
Their UI, if you used the daisy cocoon wiki on top of the repository was not
very friendly for this though. I have only been working with the repository
lately though, so this may have changed over the last 6 months.

  - language variants are at a per-document level rather than a
&gt;<i> per-field level, which is what OpenRecord needs
</I>

I can't comment too much on this since I haven't looked into their i18n
support - my current use is as a personal knowledgebase. Funny, since I used
to do a lot of i18n work during my NLP days. But since 'document' is the
root entity for all instance data, I assume you have to associate lang
variants at this level for instance data. However, the same 'field type' (
e.g. hasName) can be referenced in multiple documents, and you can have a
collection of locales associated with the labels of a 'fields type' (e.g.
hasName:en~someFoo:cn). But if you create a Chinese document variant, those
fields are assumed to have Chinese content.

I struggled with the notion of everything being a 'document' for instance
data in Daisy, but if I create a 'version' of an RDF graph I'll still need a
semantically similar concept in the form of a quad, named graph, or rely on
a lot of reification. I'm sorry I'm not more familiar with your project, but
how did you plan to handle this?

&gt;<i> Regarding the charting code mentioned in the last update, you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may also want to look at this recent code:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html">http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the pointer.  The WebFX charts look great.  Unfortunately the
</I>&gt;<i> WebFX licenses are too restrictive for us to use WebFX code in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenRecord.  But hopefully the Dojo chart widget will gradually start to
</I>&gt;<i> have more and more features.
</I>

Sorry, I know little about licensing. I think it is an MIT license in the
source files, although he mentions some of his code being GNU on the
website. Not sure how this conflicts with your licensing model though.

&gt;<i> Thanks! The project sounds very interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all the suggestions.  Let me know if you have any other ideas
</I>&gt;<i> about the data store -- with enough searching I'm hopefully that we'll
</I>&gt;<i> eventually find a fit!
</I>

I think you've covered most of the data models I've looked at, but here's
another random project that you may be interested in. Not much to it, but
interesting - I just happened to see it this evening.

Hope this didn't ramble too much, I stayed up a little too late working this
evening... well I guess it's morning now. :-)

cheers,
Ian
