<PRE>Hey Ian,

Thanks for all the great info.  I'm eager to go read about everything 
you just pointed me to.  I'm swamped today, and I'll be away on 
Wednesday and Thursday, but hopefully on Friday I'll have a chance to 
dive into this!

Cheers,
   Brian

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; For example, an rdf store (also listed) could subsume any of
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; the models you mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     RDF is appealing.  It's been a couple years since I last looked at RDF
</I>&gt;<i>     datastores, but at the time I had trouble finding something that fit.
</I>&gt;<i>     In particular, I had trouble finding a datastore with built-in support
</I>&gt;<i>     for tracking change histories and version info.  For example, on the
</I>&gt;<i>     Wikipedia site, each page has a &quot;history&quot; tab, where you can see all the
</I>&gt;<i>     previous versions of the page, as well as the diffs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Do you know of any RDF datastore that has built in support for the idea
</I>&gt;<i>     of versions and version histories?  Without built in versioning support,
</I>&gt;<i>     I think we would maybe end up having to represent every single
</I>&gt;<i>     statement
</I>&gt;<i>     as a reified statement, and if we did that I'm worried that queries
</I>&gt;<i>     would be a pain and performance would suck.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have you looked into the 'named graph' or quad support some of the RDF 
</I>&gt;<i> stores have added? Sesame 2 is very nice, although still in alpha, and 
</I>&gt;<i> now supports context. It also has an HTTP api, and supports the new W3C 
</I>&gt;<i> rdf query language, SPARQL, for extracting subgraphs. I agree 
</I>&gt;<i> reification can get messy quickly, depending on how you use it - 
</I>&gt;<i> although indexing strategies can get around some headaches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You may also want to take a look at C-Store - which has some 
</I>&gt;<i> similarities to Google's BigTable work. It's a column store open source 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I am more critical of with triplestores is the scaling issues, and 
</I>&gt;<i> data management issues. By data management issues, I mean Daisy has a 
</I>&gt;<i> nice division in the form of 'parts' that allows you to store a typed 
</I>&gt;<i> blob and attach a bunch of key/values to it ( i.e. creating a 
</I>&gt;<i> 'document'). You can always dereference a bunch of blobs via URIs 
</I>&gt;<i> referenced from an RDF store, but there isn't an established API for 
</I>&gt;<i> this in any of the rdf stores - you would have to setup your own 
</I>&gt;<i> blobstore and extend the query api's, and end up rolling something 
</I>&gt;<i> similar to daisy, I imagine. Then there is ACL's, etc. and other 
</I>&gt;<i> niceties that are not supported by most of the RDF stores. Daisy 
</I>&gt;<i> abstracts many of these issues nicely in their HTTP APIs. That having 
</I>&gt;<i> been said, I often find myself split down the middle to dump daisy for 
</I>&gt;<i> an RDF store, as I watch daisy evolve more extensions to their own query 
</I>&gt;<i> language, etc.. But theoretically, most anything can be layered on a 
</I>&gt;<i> triple/quad - it's just that the implemantations still have a ways to go.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One other weakness, that is probably easily fixed, is that XML is the 
</I>&gt;<i> only return type for the Daisy api - JSON would be nice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we agree there are no ideal solutions at the moment, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> how I stumbled on to your list.:-) Incidentally, I am working with life 
</I>&gt;<i> sciences data - if the email didn't give that away.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've also been playing with Daisy for a while now, and would be happy to 
</I>&gt;<i> answer any questions - if I am able. Otherwise, the developers are 
</I>&gt;<i> always very helpful on the mailing list, and pretty open to discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> of extensions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; daisy also mentioned, seems like a nice model with a ReST api.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The Daisy CMS seems cool.  I don't know much about it, but there are a
</I>&gt;<i>     bunch of sweet features that seem like they would be useful for
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenRecord: the ReST API, multi-valued fields, versioning, language
</I>&gt;<i>     variants, retired documents, transclusion, embedded queries, fields
</I>&gt;<i>     shared across different document types, unique IDs instead of
</I>&gt;<i>     hierarchical directory paths.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     But, in other ways Daisy doesn't seem like a fit for the OpenRecord
</I>&gt;<i>     data
</I>&gt;<i>     model.  For OpenRecord, I think the biggest problems are that in Daisy:
</I>&gt;<i>       - fields can hold literal values, but I can't find any documentation
</I>&gt;<i>     about fields being able to hold pointers to other documents
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is possible now -  if I understood your request correctly. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if it was 1.4 or 1.5 (this is the current Trunk version, 
</I>&gt;<i> and what I am currently working with).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> from one of the developer's posts on the mailing list:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A link field is a field which links to another document (or documents, 
</I>&gt;<i> in case of multivalue fields). This allows for structured linking 
</I>&gt;<i> between documents.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     much less
</I>&gt;<i>     automatic bi-directional connections
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  By &quot;automatic bi-directional connections&quot; do you mean &quot;inverse 
</I>&gt;<i> properties&quot;? In RDF world, this would look like Car:hasName:CoolCar &lt;--&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> CoolCar:isNameof:Car
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also interesting about Daisy, you can define a query to populate a 
</I>&gt;<i> SelectionList now - something I had been waiting for - this is from the 
</I>&gt;<i> new linktype support mentioned above. And defining ACL's using queries 
</I>&gt;<i> is also nice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       - a document must belong to a document type, can only belong to one
</I>&gt;<i>     document type, 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, these are assumptions in the Daisy model - and have led me to 
</I>&gt;<i> consider rolling my own solution. I've been able to fit most of my 
</I>&gt;<i> current use into these assumptions though. But there has to be some 
</I>&gt;<i> organizing unit by which you create versions off of, no? Perhaps you can 
</I>&gt;<i> comment on your thinking for this..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     and can only have the fields that are defined for its
</I>&gt;<i>     document type
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually you can always extend the fields associated with a document 
</I>&gt;<i> type - I do this all the time. Maybe I am misunderstanding your question 
</I>&gt;<i> though. Their UI, if you used the daisy cocoon wiki on top of the 
</I>&gt;<i> repository was not very friendly for this though. I have only been 
</I>&gt;<i> working with the repository lately though, so this may have changed over 
</I>&gt;<i> the last 6 months.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       - language variants are at a per-document level rather than a
</I>&gt;<i>     per-field level, which is what OpenRecord needs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't comment too much on this since I haven't looked into their i18n 
</I>&gt;<i> support - my current use is as a personal knowledgebase. Funny, since I 
</I>&gt;<i> used to do a lot of i18n work during my NLP days. But since 'document' 
</I>&gt;<i> is the root entity for all instance data, I assume you have to associate 
</I>&gt;<i> lang variants at this level for instance data. However, the same 'field 
</I>&gt;<i> type' ( e.g. hasName) can be referenced in multiple documents, and you 
</I>&gt;<i> can have a collection of locales associated with the labels of a 'fields 
</I>&gt;<i> type' (e.g. hasName:en~someFoo:cn). But if you create a Chinese document 
</I>&gt;<i> variant, those fields are assumed to have Chinese content.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I struggled with the notion of everything being a 'document' for 
</I>&gt;<i> instance data in Daisy, but if I create a 'version' of an RDF graph I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> still need a semantically similar concept in the form of a quad, named 
</I>&gt;<i> graph, or rely on a lot of reification. I'm sorry I'm not more familiar 
</I>&gt;<i> with your project, but how did you plan to handle this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; Regarding the charting code mentioned in the last update, you
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; may also want to look at this recent code:
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; <A HREF="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html">http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html">http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Thanks for the pointer.  The WebFX charts look great.  Unfortunately the
</I>&gt;<i>     WebFX licenses are too restrictive for us to use WebFX code in
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenRecord.  But hopefully the Dojo chart widget will gradually
</I>&gt;<i>     start to
</I>&gt;<i>     have more and more features.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I know little about licensing. I think it is an MIT license in 
</I>&gt;<i> the source files, although he mentions some of his code being GNU on the 
</I>&gt;<i> website. Not sure how this conflicts with your licensing model though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; Thanks! The project sounds very interesting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Thanks for all the suggestions.  Let me know if you have any other
</I>&gt;<i>     ideas
</I>&gt;<i>     about the data store -- with enough searching I'm hopefully that we'll
</I>&gt;<i>     eventually find a fit!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you've covered most of the data models I've looked at, but 
</I>&gt;<i> here's another random project that you may be interested in. Not much to 
</I>&gt;<i> it, but interesting - I just happened to see it this evening.
