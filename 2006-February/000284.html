<PRE>Hey David, thanks for the detailed feedback.  I've added those 
suggestions to our to-do list for the next rev of the screencast.

Some responses inline...

&gt;<i> 1) most importantly: I watched it all, even though it's 
</I>&gt;<i> longer than I expected.  I'm pretty impressed, not just 
</I>&gt;<i> with the screencast, but with openrecord.  So good job!
</I>
Thanks, that's encouraging to hear!

&gt;<i> 3) audio is clear
</I>
I just got a new Logitech USB microphone for making the screencast. 
Alex, let me know if you'd like it for making the Dojo screencasts. 
It's noticeably better than the old microphone I first tried.

&gt;<i> 5) Affordance of editability in the book club app isn't
</I>&gt;<i> obvious (suggest different background on hover).  Same 
</I>&gt;<i> for drag and dropability.
</I>
That's funny -- we actually used to have a visual cue on hover, back in 
an earlier version.  We must have broken that accidentally at some 
point, and I hadn't noticed.  I've added a entry about that in our bug 
tracking file.

&gt;<i> 7) too bad you're using a <A HREF="file://">file://</A> url -- distracts from 
</I>&gt;<i> the webapp concept
</I>
Yup, we'll definitely use http: urls in the next screencast.  Right as I 
was making the screencasts I ran into some glitch with our code that 
only happened on the machine that I had the screencast software on, and 
only in http: mode.  Very frustrating.  The screencast was already weeks 
late, so I figured it was better to press on in file: mode rather than 
spend time debugging.

But, I do think it's cool that OpenRecord actually works in file: mode 
as well as http: mode, at least until we replace our file-based 
datastore with some more scalable solution.

&gt;<i> 8) I want to know how to build the book club, not just edit it.
</I>
The UI for setting up new sites is still clunky, so I felt I had to 
leave that out.  We've just started working on UI improvements for that, 
and we should be able to show that off in the next screencast.

&gt;<i> 10) do you have &quot;choice&quot; types?
</I>
We don't have any sort of an &quot;enum&quot; type -- for example, you can't set 
up the &quot;party&quot; attribute to have a fixed set of values: [Democratic, 
Republican, Green, Libertarian].  That's actually an intentional feature 
omission, rather than just something we haven't gotten around to...

I'm hoping that we can avoid needing an &quot;enum&quot; feature, and instead 
encourage people to do something similar but modeled by using 
relationships to other items.  So, instead of the &quot;party&quot; attribute 
being declared as an enum, it would be declared as a reference to an 
item in the category &quot;Political Party&quot;, which would include items for 
Democratic, Republican, Green, Libertarian, etc.  That way it's easy to 
add more info about any of the parties.  The downside is that we then 
don't restrict the user to *only* picking from one of the existing 
parties -- the user is free to create new items representing other parties.

&gt;<i> 11) the blue rounded corner styling on the links to items 
</I>&gt;<i> are getting on my nerves
</I>
I'd welcome ideas about alternatives, if you maybe had something in 
mind.  That's been a hard UI element to design...

We could make the item links look like a traditional links (simple blue 
underline), but that's maybe confusing, given that the item links aren't 
traditional links, and don't have quite the same UI affordances.  For 
example, with a normal link, a single click follows the link.  But, in 
OpenRecord, on those item connections, we probably need the single click 
action to select the connection, so that you can then do stuff like 
cut/copy/paste/drag/etc.  Right now, the UI is set up so that you have 
to double click to follow the link, although I was hoping to avoid 
double-click operations entirely.

&gt;<i> 12) create CSS for the plugin generator. =)
</I>&gt;<i> 15) I think openrecord could use some css-love.
</I>
Yup, OpenRecord needs some style.  I've been mostly ignoring that 
problem.  I'm banking on the dojo widgets getting some unified style, so 
that then we can just have OpenRecord use dojo widgets, and use some 
similar style for any custom UI in OpenRecord.

&gt;<i> 13) I'm curious about the reporting capabilities of the engine...
</I>
I'm not sure I know what you mean by reporting.  Do you mean, what sort 
of queries you can use to populate a view with items to display?  Or do 
you mean some sort of reporting view that's more geared toward printed 
reports?  Any particular use cases we should be thinking about?


&gt;<i> The screencast seems aimed halfway towards developers and 
</I>&gt;<i> halfway towards users.  I think it would be good to aim more 
</I>&gt;<i> towards users, and trim some of the jargon (esp. at the end   
</I>&gt;<i> of the concurrency section).
</I>
The screencast is meant to be geared toward developers rather than 
users.  I figure some of the first things a developer needs to know 
about OpenRecord are what features the app has and what the app looks 
like to a user, so that's why the first half of the screencast has a lot 
of usage examples.

We haven't yet decided what we want to use for a back-end datastore, and 
until we get something solid in place, I'm actively discouraging users 
from actually trusting OpenRecord with data they care about.  So, for 
now, we're not working on attracting users -- so, no need for a 
user-oriented screencast.

We are definitely interested in inviting developers to work on 
OpenRecord, and in getting feedback and suggestions from developers (for 
example, about what datastore components we should be thinking about, 
and about what other open source projects we should be collaborating with).

&gt;<i> For developers, I'd show more code.  A lot more code =).
</I>
Point taken.  I've added that to the to-do list for the next rev of the 
screencast.

&gt;<i> I'm definitely more interested in openrecord than I was ten 
</I>&gt;<i> minutes ago.  Cool.
</I>
Thanks!

:<i>o) Brian
