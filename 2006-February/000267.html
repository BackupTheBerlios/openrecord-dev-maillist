<PRE>Here's a quick summary of recent news about the OpenRecord project.

In the past month...

+ Mignon reimplemented our drag-and-drop code, using the dojo.dnd 
package instead of script.aculo.us.  That removed our last dependencies 
on the script.aculo.us and prototype libraries, and we've now removed 
those libraries from OpenRecord, which simplifies life by leaving Dojo 
as our only run-time library dependency.

+ We made our first code contributions from OpenRecord to the Dojo 
Toolkit.  Brian ported the OpenRecord UUID code to dojo.uuid, and thanks 
to feedback from Tom at Dojo, we were able to significantly improve the 
code in the process.  OpenRecord code also made it into the 
dojo.lang.assert and dojo.lang.type packages.

+ Zhenjian joined the OpenRecord project, and has started to look at 
making an improved BarChart plugin, building on Tom's SVG work in Dojo. 
  Zhenjian is in China, and will be our first contributor outside the 
United States, unless Rowan in Ireland reappears soon and beats him to it!

+ We created the first OpenRecord plugin to experimentally use a dojo 
widget, another small step in the gradual Dojo-ification of the 
OpenRecord code.

+ We introduced Dustin at Dojo to Matt at OSAF, both of whom are working 
on JavaScript calendaring code.  Hopefully there may be some opportunity 
for collaboration between the two projects.

+ Brian attended a Dojo &quot;data-provider&quot; meeting with 10 of the Dojo 
contributors, to start planning a general purpose Dojo data binding 
architecture.  Brian also started writing an experimental straw-man 
implementation of some of the data provider code.  If all goes well, 
Dojo will someday provide a wide variety of widgets which can be bound 
to a wide variety of data sources, and OpenRecord itself can be a fairly 
thin layer on top of that infrastructure.  As part of this work, we've 
also started a data model comparison table:
  <A HREF="http://openrecord.org/dojo/2006-01-09/data_model_comparison.html">http://openrecord.org/dojo/2006-01-09/data_model_comparison.html</A>

+ Brian has been exchanging mail with a Google contact, hoping for some 
possible collaboration (however unlikely) in which Google might host a 
fully supported version of OpenRecord, complementing the freely 
available open source version.

+ We were also lucky enough to be introduced to an attorney at the 
Software Freedom Law Center, who will hopefully be able to give us some 
advice about our licensing choices.

+ We now have 14 people subscribed to the openrecord-dev mailing list:

Cheers,
