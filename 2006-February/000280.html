<PRE>Hi Ian,

Thanks again for all your suggestions about stuff to look at.  The 
material you're pointing me to is extremely useful.  Responses inline...


&gt;<i>     Do you know of any RDF datastore that has built in support 
</I>&gt;<i>     for the idea of versions and version histories?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have you looked into the 'named graph' or quad support some of 
</I>&gt;<i> the RDF stores have added? Sesame 2 is very nice, although still 
</I>&gt;<i> in alpha, and now supports context. It also has an HTTP api... 
</I>
I've been out of touch with the RDF world -- I don't think I'd ever even 
heard of 'named graphs' or contexts or quad stores.  That's an 
encouraging development.  The support for contexts makes RDF stores like 
Sesame 2 and YARS a much better match for what we need with OpenRecord.

When I've got more time, it'd be great to read more about these quad 
stores and play around with them some.  Just in doing some quick 
skimming, I've seen some examples that show how you might use contexts 
for keeping track of the attribution/provenance of RDF triples.  But I 
haven't seen examples of using the contexts to provide stuff like 
transaction logs and version histories.  I'm sure we could make that 
work, but I worry about the query performance if those features aren't 
baked into the store/query system.  I guess at this point we'd really 
need to just try using one of these stores for OpenRecord, and see what 
the performance looks like.


&gt;<i> You may also want to take a look at C-Store - which has some 
</I>&gt;<i> similarities to Google's BigTable work. It's a column store 
</I>&gt;<i> open source implementation.
</I>
I hadn't ever heard of C-store or BigTable.  BigTable sounds cool.  I'd 
love to learn more about it, even though we can't actually build on top 
of it since it's proprietary.

The C-Store read-optimization sounds great, and I like the architecture 
of the Writable Store (WS), Tuple Mover, and Read-optimized Store (RS). 
   Unfortunately, C-store doesn't look like a good fit for OpenRecord, 
just because C-store has a basically a relational data model, with 
separate tables for different types of records, strongly typed columns, 
single-valued cells, etc.  But reading about C-Store's WS/RS design 
makes me feel better about one of our back-of-the-envelope designs a few 
months ago, when we were toying with the idea of rolling our own backend 
for OpenRecord.


&gt;<i> What I am more critical of with triplestores is the scaling
</I>&gt;<i> issues, and data management issues. By data management issues,
</I>&gt;<i> I mean Daisy has a nice division in the form of 'parts' that
</I>&gt;<i> allows you to store a typed blob and attach a bunch of key/
</I>&gt;<i> values to it ( i.e. creating a 'document'). You can always 
</I>&gt;<i> dereference a bunch of blobs via URIs referenced from an RDF 
</I>&gt;<i> store, but there isn't an established API for this in any of 
</I>&gt;<i> the rdf stores - you would have to setup your own blobstore 
</I>&gt;<i> and extend the query api's, and end up rolling something
</I>&gt;<i> similar to daisy, I imagine. Then there is ACL's, etc. and
</I>&gt;<i> other niceties that are not supported by most of the RDF 
</I>&gt;<i> stores. 
</I>
Yup, Daisy seems like a more mature, well rounded, full featured system. 
  That's definitely appealing.


&gt;<i> That having been said, I often find myself split down the
</I>&gt;<i> middle to dump daisy for an RDF store, as I watch daisy 
</I>&gt;<i> evolve more extensions to their own query language, etc.. 
</I>&gt;<i> But theoretically, most anything can be layered on a 
</I>&gt;<i> triple/quad - it's just that the implemantations still
</I>&gt;<i> have a ways to go.
</I>
I can see the dilemma.  Maybe in a few years one of the RDF stores will 
seem like a no-brainer.  For now, any choice involves compromises.


&gt;<i> One other weakness, that is probably easily fixed, is that 
</I>&gt;<i> XML is the only return type for the Daisy api - JSON would 
</I>&gt;<i> be nice.
</I>
JSON would be what we'd want for OpenRecord too.  That really should be 
easy to fix, shouldn't it?  Hopefully a thin layer of translation code 
in Daisy should do the job, and the Daisy folks probably wouldn't object 
to accepting that contribution into Daisy?


&gt;<i> I think we agree there are no ideal solutions at the moment, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is how I stumbled on to your list.:-)  
</I>
If you're still searching, you might want to look at the Chandler 
Repository.  I don't know what all the needs/requirements are for the 
work you're doing, but the Chandler data model has an RDF-ish flavor to 
it.  Chandler is only at 0.6 release now, but they've hard at work 
towards a production-quality 1.0 release.

&gt;<i> Incidentally, I am working with life sciences data - if the 
</I>&gt;<i> email didn't give that away.
</I>
I've heard that the Semantic Web is starting to get some traction in the 
life sciences field.  Are you working at a University?


&gt;<i> I've also been playing with Daisy for a while now, and would 
</I>&gt;<i> be happy to answer any questions - if I am able. 
</I>
Thanks for the offer -- I'll take you up on it...

&gt;<i>     But, in other ways Daisy doesn't seem like a fit for 
</I>&gt;<i>     the OpenRecord data model.  For OpenRecord, I think the 
</I>&gt;<i>     biggest problems are that in Daisy:
</I>&gt;<i>       - fields can hold literal values, but I can't find any 
</I>&gt;<i>     documentation about fields being able to hold pointers 
</I>&gt;<i>     to other documents
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is possible now - if I understood your request 
</I>&gt;<i> correctly. I'm not sure if it was 1.4 or 1.5 (this is the 
</I>&gt;<i> current Trunk version, and what I am currently working with).
</I>
I had been looking at the Daisy 1.4 documentation about the field types, 
here:
 
<A HREF="http://cocoondev.org/books/daisydocs1_4/publications/html-chunked/output/s75.html#s86">http://cocoondev.org/books/daisydocs1_4/publications/html-chunked/output/s75.html#s86</A>

In 1.4, it seems like &quot;links&quot; are just HTML URLs, and are handled 
separately from fields, which I was worried would mean that you couldn't 
have multi-valued links, or multi-valued fields with a mix of links and 
numbers and strings.

<A HREF="http://cocoondev.org/books/daisydocs1_4/publications/html-chunked/output/s75.html#s97">http://cocoondev.org/books/daisydocs1_4/publications/html-chunked/output/s75.html#s97</A>
<A HREF="http://cocoondev.org/books/daisydocs1_4/publications/html-chunked/output/s75.html#s98">http://cocoondev.org/books/daisydocs1_4/publications/html-chunked/output/s75.html#s98</A>

&gt;<i> from one of the developer's posts on the mailing list:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A link field is a field which links to another document (or 
</I>&gt;<i> documents, in case of multivalue fields). This allows for 
</I>&gt;<i> structured linking between documents.&quot;
</I>
Yup, that quote sounds promising.

&gt;<i>     much less automatic bi-directional connections
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  By &quot;automatic bi-directional connections&quot; do you mean  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;inverse properties&quot;? In RDF world, this would look like  
</I>&gt;<i> Car:hasName:CoolCar &lt;--&gt; CoolCar:isNameof:Car
</I>
Yes, that's pretty much what I mean by bi-directional connections.  The 
Car item and the CoolCar item each have a property that points to the 
other item, and if you change one either of those properties, the other 
item(s) will automatically update.

For example:

   // starting out
   assert( Car.getValuesForProperty(hasName) == [CoolCar] );
   assert( CoolCar.getValuesForProperty(isNameof) == [Car] );

   // now add a value
   Car.addValueForProperty(hasName, BlueCar);

   // and now
   assert( Car.getValuesForProperty(hasName) == [CoolCar, BlueCar] );
   assert( BlueCar.getValuesForProperty(isNameof) == [Car] );
   assert( CoolCar.getValuesForProperty(isNameof) == [Car] );

A bunch of data stores and data models seem to have that notion of 
automatically maintaining inverse properties.  In OpenRecord we're 
currently implementing that feature in a slightly unconventional way -- 
in our data representation the two inverse properties actually share a 
single value (a connection value) rather than each property having a 
value that's the inverse of the other.


&gt;<i>       - a document must belong to a document type, can only 
</I>&gt;<i>     belong to one document type, 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, these are assumptions in the Daisy model - and have led 
</I>&gt;<i> me to consider rolling my own solution. I've been able to fit 
</I>&gt;<i> most of my current use into these assumptions though. But 
</I>&gt;<i> there has to be some organizing unit by which you create 
</I>&gt;<i> versions off of, no? Perhaps you can comment on your thinking 
</I>&gt;<i> for this..
</I>
In OpenRecord we've tried to avoid the idea of fixed schemas.  You can 
create items willy-nilly, rather than creating items of a given type. 
Users can put items in categories (so you can say that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a 
&quot;Book&quot;), but the categories act more like tags than data types.  An item 
can belong to several different categories at once.  A category doesn't 
have any notion of what attributes its items should have (&quot;Title&quot;, 
&quot;Author&quot;, etc.).  We end up handling that sort of schema information in 
the data entry views, rather than in the data model.


&gt;<i>     and can only have the fields that are defined for its
</I>&gt;<i>     document type
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually you can always extend the fields associated with a 
</I>&gt;<i> document type - I do this all the time. Maybe I am 
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding your question though. 
</I>
Rather than adding fields to a document type, what I really want to do 
is add &quot;ad hoc&quot; fields to an individual document.  So, maybe most books 
have just &quot;title&quot; and &quot;author&quot; fields, but one particular book can have 
a field &quot;page numbers of dog-eared pages&quot;.  I think this is similar to 
the Daisy idea of Custom Fields, but the Daisy 1.4 documentation says 
that custom fields are just name-value pairs where unfortunately the 
value can only be a text string, changes are not versioned, and the 
field is identified by a name string, not a field ID.

&gt;<i>       - language variants are at a per-document level rather 
</I>&gt;<i>     than a per-field level, which is what OpenRecord needs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't comment too much on this since I haven't looked into 
</I>&gt;<i> their i18n support - my current use is as a personal knowledgebase. 
</I>&gt;<i> ... But since 'document' is the root entity for all instance
</I>&gt;<i> data, I assume you have to associate lang variants at this level
</I>&gt;<i> for instance data. ... I'm sorry I'm not more familiar with  
</I>&gt;<i> your project, but how did you plan to handle this?
</I>
I may be misunderstanding Daisy, but let me explain what I had in mind 
for OpenRecord.

One of the things we'd like to be able to do with OpenRecord is a set up 
a World Almanac site, containing lots of graphs and charts of the sort 
of quantitative content you find in reference books like the CIA world 
factbook.

To keep track of information about Germany, we would have a Germany 
item, with attributes like:

  {item-id: 12845782,
    name: (&quot;Germany&quot;),
    area: (357,021 sq km),
    pop:  (82,431,390),
    capital: ([pointer to item representing Berlin]) }

When we create language variants, we really want to do that on a field 
by field basis.  We don't want each variant to have a separate copy of 
the values for Land Area, Population, and Capital.

We'd like to do this:
  {item-id: 12845782,
    name: [{lang:&quot;en&quot;, value:&quot;Germany&quot;},
           {lang:&quot;de&quot;, value:&quot;Deutchland&quot;}],
    area: (357,021 sq km),
    pop:  (82,431,390),
    capital: ([pointer to item representing Berlin]) }

Rather than this:
  {item-id: 12845782,
   variants: [
    { lang: &quot;en&quot;,
      name: (&quot;Germany&quot;),
      area: (357,021 sq km),
      pop:  (82,431,390),
      capital: ([pointer to item representing Berlin]) },
    { lang: &quot;de&quot;,
      name: (&quot;Deutchland&quot;),
      area: (357,021 sq km),
      pop:  (82,431,390),
      capital: ([pointer to item representing Berlin]) } ] }


&gt;<i>      &gt; Regarding the charting code mentioned in the last 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; update, you may also want to look at this recent
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; code: <A HREF="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html">http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Thanks for the pointer.  The WebFX charts look great.  
</I>&gt;<i>     Unfortunately the WebFX licenses are too restrictive 
</I>&gt;<i>     for us to use WebFX code in OpenRecord.   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I know little about licensing. I think it is an MIT 
</I>&gt;<i> license in the source files, although he mentions some of 
</I>&gt;<i> his code being GNU on the website. Not sure how this conflicts 
</I>&gt;<i> with your licensing model though.
</I>
Oh, cool.  You're absolutely right.  The source code file is labeled 
with an MIT license.  I had only looked at the web site license info 
page, which talks about the GNU GPL and commercial licenses by special 
request only.  We can't use GNU GPL components in OpenRecord, but we can 
include MIT license code.  Thanks for the pointer!
