<PRE>Hi Bio,

&gt;<i> The table you released comparing different data models was very 
</I>&gt;<i> nice, thank you. Will you be rolling your own backend, or using  
</I>&gt;<i> one of the models mentioned? 
</I>
I'd like to avoid writing our own backend.  Writing one would take more 
time than we have, and the result would probably be lame compared to 
existing backends.  I'd much rather use an existing backend. 
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble finding an existing backend that seems 
like a good match for the OpenRecord data model.  I'm still actively 
looking, so let me know if you have suggestions.


&gt;<i> For example, an rdf store (also listed) could subsume any of 
</I>&gt;<i> the models you mentioned  
</I>
RDF is appealing.  It's been a couple years since I last looked at RDF 
datastores, but at the time I had trouble finding something that fit. 
In particular, I had trouble finding a datastore with built-in support 
for tracking change histories and version info.  For example, on the 
Wikipedia site, each page has a &quot;history&quot; tab, where you can see all the 
previous versions of the page, as well as the diffs.

Do you know of any RDF datastore that has built in support for the idea 
of versions and version histories?  Without built in versioning support, 
I think we would maybe end up having to represent every single statement 
as a reified statement, and if we did that I'm worried that queries 
would be a pain and performance would suck.


&gt;<i> daisy also mentioned, seems like a nice model with a ReST api.
</I>
The Daisy CMS seems cool.  I don't know much about it, but there are a 
bunch of sweet features that seem like they would be useful for 
OpenRecord: the ReST API, multi-valued fields, versioning, language 
variants, retired documents, transclusion, embedded queries, fields 
shared across different document types, unique IDs instead of 
hierarchical directory paths.

But, in other ways Daisy doesn't seem like a fit for the OpenRecord data 
model.  For OpenRecord, I think the biggest problems are that in Daisy:
  - fields can hold literal values, but I can't find any documentation 
about fields being able to hold pointers to other documents, much less 
automatic bi-directional connections
  - a document must belong to a document type, can only belong to one 
document type, and can only have the fields that are defined for its 
document type
  - language variants are at a per-document level rather than a 
per-field level, which is what OpenRecord needs


&gt;<i> Regarding the charting code mentioned in the last update, you 
</I>&gt;<i> may also want to look at this recent code: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html">http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/chart/chart.html</A> 
</I>
Thanks for the pointer.  The WebFX charts look great.  Unfortunately the 
WebFX licenses are too restrictive for us to use WebFX code in 
OpenRecord.  But hopefully the Dojo chart widget will gradually start to 
have more and more features.


&gt;<i> Thanks! The project sounds very interesting.
</I>
Thanks for all the suggestions.  Let me know if you have any other ideas 
about the data store -- with enough searching I'm hopefully that we'll 
eventually find a fit!

Cheers,
   Brian
