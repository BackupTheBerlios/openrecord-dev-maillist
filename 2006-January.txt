Happy New Year!
Welcome to 2006.

If all goes well, this will be the year we ship a first version of 
OpenRecord, and start setting up real web sites with it!

Subject: [openrecord-dev] OpenRecord links for YU Zhenjian
Message-ID: <43C48B62.3050901@dojotoolkit.org>

Hi Jason,

Thanks for coming over today.  You asked me to put together a list of
links, with background material about OpenRecord, the OpenRecord data
model, etc.  Here's what I came up with -- some of this I had sent you
before, but I've added a bunch of new links as well.

Feel free to forward all of this to YU Zhenjian.  I'm cc'ing this to
the openrecord-dev mailing list, for the sake of transparency, and so
that it will be archived where we can easily find it.

Cheers,
  Brian

1. Dojo Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)

Before we can accept any code from anyone, we need to have a signed
copy of a Dojo Contributor License Agreement.  Here's the Dojo web
page about licensing:
   http://dojotoolkit.org/docs/licensing.html

Here's the Individual Contributor License Agreement, for YU Zhenjian
to sign:
   http://dojotoolkit.org/icla.txt

Here's the Dojo Corporate Contributor License Agreement, for ThumbDrive
to sign:
   http://dojotoolkit.org/ccla.txt

The CLAs say to send the signed forms to the Dojo Foundation in Palo
Alto, but it would actually be better to send them directly to me, and
I'll make copies and then send them on to the Dojo Foundation.  Here's
my address:

   Brian Skinner
   2043 Ninth Avenue
   San Francisco, CA 94116-1302
   USA


---------------------------------------------------------
2. Tools

OpenRecord only runs in Firefox, not Internet Explorer, and OpenRecord
has only been tested under Windows XP and on the Mac, not on Linux
computers.  So, YU Zhenjian will need a copy of Firefox, and he will
need a Windows computer or a Mac, unless he wants the be the first to
try OpenRecord on Linux.  Here's the Firefox download page:
   http://www.mozilla.com/

The OpenRecord project and the Dojo project both use Subversion for all
the source code version control, so he will need to get set up with a
Subversion client, if he doesn't have one already.  Here's the link for
that:
   http://subversion.tigris.org/


---------------------------------------------------------
3. Source code

Once he has a subversion client, the first thing to do is get a copy of
the source code, browse through it all, try running the unit tests, try
running OpenRecord, etc.  Here's the web page with info about anonymous
SVN access to the OpenRecord code:
   http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=3396

The OpenRecord source tree should automatically include a copy the Dojo
source tree, which is worth looking at too.


---------------------------------------------------------
4. Background reading

As well as the source code itself, there's also a bunch of other
material available.

Here's the main OpenRecord web site, with overview info, bookmarks,
etc:
   http://openrecord.org/

Here's a PDF file with slides from a presentation last August.  This
gives some background about the OpenRecord design:
   http://openrecord.org/demo/old_2005_08_17/meeting_notes/2005-08-18_notes.pdf

Here's a mailing list message that explains some of the terminology for
the OpenRecord data model, and describes how OpenRecord data is stored:
   http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openrecord-dev/2005-October/000248.html

Here are some examples of using the OpenRecord data model API:
   http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/openrecord/trunk/documentation/data_model_api.txt

Here's the Dojo web site, including the Dojo Manual and other good stuff:
   http://dojotoolkit.org/
   http://dojotoolkit.org/docs/

Here's a free book about working on an Open Source Software project:
   http://producingoss.com/

Here's some information about products like OpenRecord:
   http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openrecord-dev/2005-December/000261.html
   http://openrecord.org/bookmarks.html


---------------------------------------------------------
5. OpenRecord demo documents

Examples of OpenRecord documents:
   http://gumption.org/openrecord/demo/old_2005_08_17/open_agenda.html
   http://gumption.org/openrecord/demo/old_2005_08_17/tobacco.html

A sandbox, where you can play around and try things out:
   http://gumption.org/openrecord/demo/old_2005_08_17/sandbox.html


---------------------------------------------------------
6. Pivot table material

Here's my old 2004 experiment, where I started to make a web-based
DHTML pivot table:
   http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/test_page.html

Here's the source code for the pivot table:
   http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/

Here's more background reading about pivot tables:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table


---------------------------------------------------------
7. Bar chart material

The Dojo Chart Widget (dojo.widget.Chart) displays graphs and charts
using the built-in SVG rendering engine in Firefox 1.5.  In OpenRecord,
we can use dojo.widget.Chart to draw graphs and charts of the values
in the attributes of OpenRecord items.

If you have Firefox 1.5 (not 1.0.7), you'll be able to see this example
of output drawn by the dojo.widget.Chart widget:
   http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-0.2.1/dojo-0.2.1-widget/tests/widget/test_Chart.html

OpenRecord already has a simple Bar Chart plugin, but it does not yet
use dojo.widget.Chart, and it uses simple HTML boxes instead of SVG
rendering.  Here's an example of an OpenRecord page with a simple Bar
Chart:
   http://openrecord.org/demo/old_2005_08_17/open_agenda.html#page5ebf9280-0c6e-11da-beea-000c414ce854

Here's a much more impressive example of using HTML and CSS and JavaScript
to create Bar Charts.  Unfortunately, we can't conveniently use this code in
OpenRecord, unless the author decides to donate it to the Dojo Foundation.
However, even if we can't use the code, it is still a useful example of
what can be done:

Subject: [openrecord-dev] dojo.data meeting - data model comparison table
Message-ID: <43C565DB.1010002@dojotoolkit.org>

Looks like about 10 of us are planning to be at the Dojo meeting on 
Thursday evening, to talk about the data-grid and data-provider design.

I've been reading up on different data stores: RDBMSs, JotSpot, Ning, 
Dabble, Jackrabbit, etc.  I was curious what features the different data 
stores offer, particularly in terms of how the data itself is 
represented (the data model).

I've started putting together a comparison table, showing a dozen 
different data stores, and comparing some of the terminology they use 
and the features they offer:
   http://openrecord.org/dojo/2006-01-09/data_model_comparison.html

So far only about half of the table is filled in, but if this seems like 
a useful resource, we could work on filling in more of it.

Cheers,
   Brian

Interesting table and very useful. Can't you host this on openrecord :)

Yup, I'd love to host that table in OpenRecord.  We'll be ready for that 
soon.  We're quite there yet.  We haven't yet stabilized the file 
format, so I don't want start getting too much real content in 
OpenRecord, because then we'll just have to write format conversion 
scripts later!
