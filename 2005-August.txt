Hi Brian,

One of the cool Bookmarklets I mentioned in the email below is "Shell".

It's a very useful Bookmarklet as it's basically a "Javascript  
Listener" for whatever HTML page you're on.

But what's even more interesting from OpenRecord's (and probably  
ClipClip's) point of view is this:
1) "Shell" is installed as a bookmarklet
2) HOWEVER, the scripts you type into "shell" (after you activate the  
bookmarklet), don't seem to fall into the usual Bookmarklet  
restrictions e.g. you can make XMLHttpRequest()s. I tried  
Util.getStringContentsOfFileAtURL('http://my.yahoo.com/') and it worked!

So, this may be a way around security restrictions around  
bookmarklets which I think is what you're looking for?

Yesterday I installed Firefox on my new Windows notebook, which meant I had
convenient access to a brand new copy of Firefox that had never run the
OpenRecord code which seeks permission to save to the local file system.  

As a test, I tried to duplicate the events that might have happened on
Mimi's machine.  I opened an OpenRecord document from a "file://" path and
made some small edit.  I got the normal dialog box asking me for permission
to write to the local file system.  I hit the "Allow" button, but I did not
check the "Remember this decision" check-box.  My edit did get recorded in
the JSON repository file, and I did not get any alert() messages showing up.


Then I made another edit, and I got the exact same dialog box asking me for
permission to write to the local file system.  I repeated that a couple more
times, but every time it worked just the way you would expect it to, without
any alert() messages.

So, I think we should rule out the "Remember this decision" check-box as a
factor in the problem.  Unfortunately, I have no clue what else might be
causing the problem.  I think we'd have to debug on Mimi's machine in order
to figure out what's up, but I'm hoping maybe the problem will just go away
of its own accord when Mimi gets the latest copy of the source code!

Subject: [openrecord-dev] anchors and URLs
Message-ID: <200508050209.j7529PI30228@bat.berlios.de>

Hey Chao,

I saw that you checked in new code to provide anchor links to each section
on a PageView.

Unfortunately, our code already uses anchors in the URLs in order to specify
a particular PageView within a document.  So, for example, in the dashboard
demo document:

  .../dashboard.html
     goes to the "Intro" page

  .../dashboard.html#page99e90d10-e990-11d9-b90a-e24829d2f59b
     goes to the "Dashboard View" page

If you click on new anchor link for the "Later" section, that changes the
existing URL, rather than just appending to it.  Clicking on the "Later"
link replaces the "hash" portion of the URL (everything from the # onward),
so the new URL becomes:

   .../dashboard.html#a1fbe7f0-f3d3-11d9-972b-e24829d2f59b

And that new URL isn't something that our URL parsing code knows what to do
with.  So, if you bookmark that URL and go back to it later, it fails to
take you back to the "Later" section of the "Dashboard View" page.  Instead
you just end up back at the main "Intro" page.

I'm not sure what the right thing to do is.  One solution might be to have
the new anchor links append to the existing URL instead of modifying it.
That way you would end up with a URL that encoded the document name
"dashboard.html", the UUID of the page within the document, *and* the UUID
of the section within the page.  And then we would need to add some code to
our URL parser to figure out where to go when given a URL. 

Another alternative would be to implement the new anchor links without
making any changes to the URL.  When you clicked on an anchor link, we could
just execute some JavaScript to scroll the window to the right place all by
ourselves, without using the hash feature of the browser.  But then you
bookmark the URL, you'll get the URL for the page, not for the specific
section within the page.

Subject: [openrecord-dev] scriptaculous slowness
Message-ID: <200508050341.j753fcI31895@bat.berlios.de>

Hey Chao,

I'm working on creating on some larger example documents.  I've been using
the CSV import tool to create documents with anywhere from 100 to 1,000
items.  

As the documents get larger, performance starts to be a real problem.
Thankfully, part of that is easy to fix.  Right now the data model code is
needlessly sorting lists over and over, which eats up more and more time as
the lists get longer.  I'll fix that.

Unfortunately, one of the big performance problems seems to be in the
scriptaculous code.  Drawing the TablePlugin is one our slowest operations,
and most of the time is spent just to register the lozenges to be draggable.


I have a table with about 1,000 items and 800 lozenges.  Our code takes
about 30 seconds to refresh the table, and about 20 seconds of that time is
spent in this one line of code:
  this._draggable = new Draggable(this._textSpan, {revert:true});

As a quick fix, for now I've changed the EntryView code so that the lozenges
are only draggable after the "Show Tools" button has been pressed.  That
makes most page loads 3-times faster, while still leaving the ability to
demo the drag-and-drop feature.

In the long run, I'm not sure what to do.  Maybe we can figure out some way
to do lazy registration of the lozenges?  Or maybe we should switch to a
different drag-and-drop library?  Or write our own code and make it far less
general?

Hi Brian,

Wow, that's good investigation! I wonder why new Draggable() is  
taking such a long time. Did you look at its code? Maybe it's worth  
asking the scriptaculous people about this.

It would be good to look at the Draggable() code and try to figure out
what's taking so long.  I haven't had a chance to do that yet, and I figure
we shouldn't bother the scriptaculous folks until we've looked at it a
little bit ourselves.  

And actually, part of it may be our fault.  The Draggable initialize()
method makes several calls to bindAsEventListener().  The scriptaculous
authors intended those bindAsEventListener() calls to be handled by the
bindAsEventListener() function in the prototype.js library, but we faked
them out by providing our own bindAsEventListener() function, defined in
Util.js.  I think our bindAsEventListener() is backward compatible with the
prototype bindAsEventListener(), but ours may take a little longer to
execute because it creates more objects and does more stuff.  Probably we
should rename our method just to avoid confusion!

Hi Brian,

Looks fantastic, I like the succinct graphics! I think you've  
captured the main points very well, raised the right issues and have  
a great flow!

More detailed comments:
Slide 2: I'm not sure if people have a reference point for what 1200  
man-hours mean. As a talking point, you could explain that it's  
basically you: 3 days/week, chao 1-2 days/week Mignon: 1day?

Slide 3: I get the basic concept. But I've some dissonance because  
the horizontal axis isn't a continuum. They seem to be disparate  
categories, with not very apparent relationships

Slide 4: I'd to pitch the target areas I'm interested in (but maybe  
they're not where your interests are?). They're mainly around social  
lightweight collaboration:
     - bookclub, investment club
     - trip/travel planning
     - small research project e.g. family genealogy,
     - knowledge base for advocacy group: e.g. facts about broadcast  
flag, Sudan, etc.

Slide 5: Great slide! Maybe highlight what is a view in the main  
diagram (pointers to Computers table and Printers outline)

Slide 6: another great slide! You may need to talk about concept of  
"units" since you have sq. km as an example.

Slide 7: Wow, lots of useful info here. Small questions:
     - Items can be tagged by anyone, not just the creator of the  
item, right? So, we should support queries to view items tagged just  
by myself (or any single individual) and also queries to view items  
tagged by everybody (i.e. just like delicious)?
     - After hearing Jimmy Wales talk, should we support anonymous  
writes?

Slide 8: We want to state in the longer run, we will have support  
beyond Firefox, right? What about architecture to support OR in 3rd  
party sites? Do we want to talk about that?

Slide 9: don't know enough to comment

I think a slide about how we fit in, and position ourselves with/ 
against Wikipedia would be interesting and fruitful for discussion.  
Also, I think Mitch is interested in collaborative decision making.  
Doesn't need to be in the prep material, but I think it should be one  
focus in our discussions. I like the demo we discussed about how we  
can make decisions to be more fact-based and criteria-based.

This is great, very useful recruiting/marketing material.

Hope this helps,
chao

Hey Chao,

Thanks for all the detailed feedback!  

I just checked in a new version of the slides with changes based on your
feedback.  So far I've made just the smaller changes, and I haven't yet
added any new pages because I'm not sure what the new pages would look like.

If you're feeling inspired over the weekend, you can have a go at adding new
pages or restructuring what's there.  You can edit the slides in
OpenOffice.org Draw, 2.0 Beta, which is easy to download and install.  Or we
can walk through the slides together when we meet up on Monday, and
brainstorm about additions and improvements. 


> Slide 3: I get the basic concept. But I've some 
> dissonance because the horizontal axis isn't a

> with not very apparent relationships

Yup, that bothered me some too.  The horizontal axis may have a loose
continuum from "unstructured" to "structured", but only some of the
categories really fall into that continuum, and the others have to be taken
with a grain of salt.  Unfortunately, I can't think how to fix that problem
without radically altering the slide and cutting lots of important ideas out
of it.  Let's talk about it on Monday and see if we can come up with
something better.

I edited slide 4 and added "stub" entries for some of those examples.
There's room for more content on that page.  You can go in and flesh out the
stubs if you have OpenOffice, or if you send me the text I can make
additions.  


> Slide 6: another great slide! You may need to talk

Yup, I'm excited about adding support for units and properties.  That's a
feature I've been wanting for 10 or 15 years now!

I feel like that's one of the big open issues with our "virtuality".  I'm
very much drawn to the delicious "bazaar" style of collaboration, but maybe
the Wikipedia "cathedral" is a better fit for most of the domains we're
thinking about.  Or, maybe there's some easy way to have both "bazaar" and
"cathedral" usage-styles without making the UI too confusing. We should sit
down with Mimi some weekend and think about where we want to go with all
this. 


>      - After hearing Jimmy Wales talk, should we support 
> anonymous writes?

Yup, maybe so.  I'd be curious to hear what discussion the Wikipedia folks
have had about potential problems with copyright infringement by allowing
anonymous writes.  That was one of my main concerns with anonymous writes,
but maybe it's a manageable problem.


> Slide 8: We want to state in the longer run, we will have

I added IE and Safari to the slide.  If we have time on Thursday, it would
also be good to talk about OpenRecord embedded in 3rd party sites, but I
haven't added it to the slide yet because I couldn't figure out an easy way
to fit it in.

Yup, agreed.  I still don't really have a demo "script" in mind, so that's
something we'll need to work out in the next few days.  It would be great if
we could figure out how to use our existing feature set to somehow show
promise toward collaborative decision making applications.  More
brainstorming for Monday!

DeltaVirtualServer creates a new FileSaver (FileStorage) it doesn't pass the
_pathToTrunkDirectory parameter the way it does when it creates a new
HttpSaver (HttpStorage), so you can only run unit tests loaded from an http:
URL, not from a file: URL.

I think it might take a some real work to get FileSaver to be able to
properly handle the _pathToTrunkDirectory parameter.  If you're feeling
bold, you could undertake that, but I think maybe a better path to follow
would be to create a new FakeStorage class and use that in the unit tests.  

The FakeStorage class wouldn't write to disk at all, so it could simply
ignore the _pathToTrunkDirectory issue.  Instead the FakeStorage class would
just have an instance variable that would keep a copy of all the text that
it had been told to store.  A unit test could do some work within a
transaction (e.g. import some XML data), and then the unit test could query
the FakeStorage instance to make sure that the right content got written to
storage.

I can work on that sometime after our demos, or if you need it sooner you
can undertake it.  I don't think it should be too much work.  I'm home
working this weekend.  Feel free to give me a call if this is a pressing
issue and you want to talk it over.

It's written entirely in Javascript so it may be more useful that  
Crockford's JSLint, which the authors acknowledged building  on top of.

Chao, thanks for the link.  I finally got around to looking at it today.
There are a couple interesting tid-bits in Johnvey's write-up about
direc.tor.  

I was intrigued by what he says in the paragraph about "Filtering and
sorting the bookmarks":
 http://johnvey.com/features/deliciousdirector/

Maybe there would be some speed advantages to using XML over JSON, depending
on what sort of manipulations we need to do on the embodied data structures?

Why do you think there would be a speed advantage with XML over JSON?

Also, I think the original link was sent because you were interested  
in using a bookmarklet to integrate OR into an existing app (e.g.  
wikipedia).

The XML and XSL processors in the browser are compiled binaries, so
operations that we can do in XSL on an XML datastore may be dramatically
faster than doing JavaScript operations on a JSON datastore.

Yup, that's on my list of things to look someday post-demo.

Unfortunately, I've already got stuff scheduled for most of the weekend.
But I might try to change my other plans to make room for BarCamp.  

I guess the best times for me would either be 
 - Friday evening from 8:00 pm onward, or
 - sometime Saturday between about noon and 10:00pm

What's your schedule like?

I don't know too much about fantasy baseball leagues, but I think there
might be a fit.  I'd love for OpenRecord to be a good tool for browsing big
data sets and slicing data by different attributes, with view like what the
mlb.com site has.  

But, we've got a lot of work ahead of us, to get there from where we are
now.  And progress may be fairly slow if we're dependent on part-time
volunteer labor.  If MLB.com has a software development budget, it might be
worth exploring the idea of having us do contract development work for them.

OpenRecord certainly fits well with the theme of the conference.  And given
that we have 5 more months of development time until the conference, I think
OpenRecord might demo nicely by then.  

I'm way to scared of public speaking to be interested in giving a talk
myself, but I'd love it if somebody else wanted to give a presentation about
the OpenRecord software.  Chao?  Marty?

Crockford's JSLint is written entirely in JavaScript too, so there's no
difference there.  Crockford's JSLint and the Out-of-Hanwell lint tool seem
to check for mostly the same things, but a few different things.  

It seems like the most significant difference is that the Out-of-Hanwell
tool is set up to be called from a bunch of environments (Visual Studio,
command line, Windows Explorer, etc.).  But I'm not sure how much of an
advantage that is for the OpenRecord project -- it seems like our current
set up works okay, with JSLint being called from our unit tests.
