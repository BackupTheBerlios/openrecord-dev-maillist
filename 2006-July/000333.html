<PRE>Hello Brian,

I thought of writing the pivot chart first since a heavy research part is
not involved in it.

Thanks for the explanation and I did an analysis based on it.

&gt;<i> For the Pivot Table, I think the biggest problem will be figuring out
</I>&gt;<i> how to take the data structures of Items and Attributes and transform
</I>&gt;<i> that data into something that makes sense to display in a Pivot Table.
</I>&gt;<i> The first problem isn't so much a programming problem as a conceptual
</I>&gt;<i> problem, or perhaps a UI design problem...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pivot Tables work best when there are a small number of axes that can be
</I>&gt;<i> pivoted (maybe 2 to 6), and where each axis has a small number of
</I>&gt;<i> possible buckets (maybe 2 to 20).
</I>
I agree. I think a drop down should be provided for the user to select chart
attributes. It is better to have an upper bound for the number of axes(E.g.:
6). But there could be attributes which are not suitable for the pivot table
( E.g.: Attributes with a unique value). The plugin can either exclude such
attributes from the drop down or display a warning that the table may be too
big to display if that attribute is selected. In order to determine suitable
attributes, I thought of comparing the item count with distinct attribute
value count and decide based on a standard (E.g.: If the item count is 50
and the an attribute has 15 distinct values, the attribute is a suitable
attribute for the chart). There could also be an upper bound for the number
of buckets (E.g.: 20).

Please tell me what you think about it.

&gt;<i> In OpenRecord, Items have Attributes with values, and those values can
</I>&gt;<i> be strings, dates, numbers, or references to other items.  It seems to
</I>&gt;<i> me that there might be more than one approach for mapping the ideas of
</I>&gt;<i> Items/Attributes/values to the ideas of Axes/Buckets/cells...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's one approach... To display a Pivot Table with 3 axes and 108
</I>&gt;<i> cells, you might populate the table from a set of 108 OpenRecord Items.
</I>&gt;<i>   So, for a table like the Gas Tax table, you might have 108 Items all
</I>&gt;<i> in the Category &quot;Donation&quot;, where each Donation Item has a 3 attributes
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;Year&quot;, &quot;Form&quot;, and &quot;Charity&quot;, plus an additional attribute
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;Amount&quot;.  An individual Donation Item might look like this:
</I>&gt;<i>    Category: Donation
</I>&gt;<i>    Year:     2001
</I>&gt;<i>    Form:     Cash
</I>&gt;<i>    Charity:  Greenbelt Alliance
</I>&gt;<i>    Amount:   $61.46
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That first approach will only work well if the number of Donation Items
</I>&gt;<i> is the same as the number of cells in the Pivot Table.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A better approach might be to allow for there to be many more Donation
</I>&gt;<i> Items, and then have the Pivot Table automatically calculate the totals.
</I>&gt;<i>   So in this second approach, there could be 5 different Donation Items
</I>&gt;<i> that are all donations of Cash in 2001 to the Greenbelt Alliance, and
</I>&gt;<i> the Pivot Table will add all 5 of the Amount values and show that total
</I>&gt;<i> in the corresponding cell of the Pivot Table.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That second approach will work smoothly if all of the Items in the
</I>&gt;<i> category Donation all have values for the 4 Attributes Year, Form,
</I>&gt;<i> Charity, and Amount.  I'm not sure what the Pivot Table code should do
</I>&gt;<i> if some of the Items are missing some Attributes, or if some of the
</I>&gt;<i> Items have Amount values that are not Numbers, or if one of the Items
</I>&gt;<i> has a multi-valued Amount Attribute.  This second approach also only
</I>&gt;<i> works well if the values that the user wants to see in the cell are
</I>&gt;<i> things that can be totaled up, like numbers.  In some other scenarios,
</I>&gt;<i> the user might not want to see the sum of a set of Attribute values, but
</I>&gt;<i> might instead want to see an average of the values, or see a count of
</I>&gt;<i> the number of Items that fall into that cell.
</I>
I thought of going for the second approach, which is complete and user
friendly. For missing information, some logic can be used to compare the
attributes values and if all nonempty attribute values are matched, the
missing information can be predicted. But if the value that appears in the
cells (additional attribute) is missing, the item can be ignored. Handling
multiple items with same data needs to be figured out. The plugin can
provide a drop down list specifying the treatment of the multiple items. For
example, the drop down can have options for numeric addition, average
calculation, and string addition. But this approach would not be effective
if the user wants average for one axis and addition for another. I'll let
you know if I find a more effective method to do this.

Again, I need your opinion.

Cheers,
Hiran
