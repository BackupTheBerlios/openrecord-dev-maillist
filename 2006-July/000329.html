<PRE>Here's a great talk by Hans Roslings, from the 2006 TED conference, if 
you've got Flash installed, and a broadband connection:
   <A HREF="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=hans_rosling">http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=hans_rosling</A>

Hans Rosling is a public health expert, and the talk is nominally about 
global development, but the talk also serves a great example of what can 
be done with the visual display of quantitative information.  In 
particular, Rosling makes a lot of use of bubble plots, which is 
especially topical for OpenRecord, since Hiran is working this week on a 
scatter-plot/bubble-plot plugin for OpenRecord.

The whole talk is about 20 minutes long.  Watching just the first 5 
minutes, that's enough to see some of the cool plots.  If you watch the 
whole thing, in the last 5 or 6 minutes he talks about data 
visualization software, and accessing database over the Internet.

Rosling shows a bunch of plots that are animated, displaying 40 years of 
time-series data in a 30-second animation.  We've talked about having 
animated views in OpenRecord too, and there's no reason we can't do that 
(just a small matter of programming).

Rosling's talk is also a nice reminder about the importance of time 
series data.  The current OpenRecord data model doesn't have any sort of 
intrinsic support for time-series data, nor does the experimental 
dojo.data code that I wrote earlier this year, nor does the data model 
code that IBM is contributing to dojo.  It would be cool to have time as 
a first-class notion in the data model, but maybe that's too ambitious. 
  I'm known for undertaking efforts that are too ambitious!

One last cool thing -- Rosling's talk is released under a Creative 
Commons license.  I'm psyched to see the CC licenses becoming more and 
more common.
