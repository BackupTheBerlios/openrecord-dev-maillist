<PRE>Hi Hiran,

&gt;&gt;<i>  For the Pivot Table, I think the biggest problem will be figuring out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  how to take the data structures of Items and Attributes and transform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  that data into something that makes sense to display in a Pivot Table.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The first problem isn't so much a programming problem as a conceptual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  problem, or perhaps a UI design problem...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Pivot Tables work best when there are a small number of axes that can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  pivoted (maybe 2 to 6), and where each axis has a small number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  possible buckets (maybe 2 to 20).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree. I think a drop down should be provided for the user to select 
</I>&gt;<i> chart attributes. It is better to have an upper bound for the number of 
</I>&gt;<i> axes(E.g.: 6). But there could be attributes which are not suitable for 
</I>&gt;<i> the pivot table ( E.g.: Attributes with a unique value). The plugin can 
</I>&gt;<i> either exclude such attributes from the drop down or display a warning 
</I>&gt;<i> that the table may be too big to display if that attribute is selected. 
</I>&gt;<i> In order to determine suitable attributes, I thought of comparing the 
</I>&gt;<i> item count with distinct attribute value count and decide based on a 
</I>&gt;<i> standard ( E.g.: If the item count is 50 and the an attribute has 15 
</I>&gt;<i> distinct values, the attribute is a suitable attribute for the chart). 
</I>&gt;<i> There could also be an upper bound for the number of buckets (E.g.: 20).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please tell me what you think about it.
</I>
That sounds like a good approach.


&gt;&gt;<i>  In OpenRecord, Items have Attributes with values, and those values can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  be strings, dates, numbers, or references to other items.  It seems to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  me that there might be more than one approach for mapping the ideas of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Items/Attributes/values to the ideas of Axes/Buckets/cells...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Here's one approach... To display a Pivot Table with 3 axes and 108
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  cells, you might populate the table from a set of 108 OpenRecord Items.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    So, for a table like the Gas Tax table, you might have 108 Items all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  in the Category &quot;Donation&quot;, where each Donation Item has a 3 attributes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  called &quot;Year&quot;, &quot;Form&quot;, and &quot;Charity&quot;, plus an additional attribute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  called &quot;Amount&quot;.  An individual Donation Item might look like this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Category: Donation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Year:     2001
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Form:     Cash
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Charity:  Greenbelt Alliance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Amount:   $61.46
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  That first approach will only work well if the number of Donation Items
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  is the same as the number of cells in the Pivot Table.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  A better approach might be to allow for there to be many more Donation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Items, and then have the Pivot Table automatically calculate the totals.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    So in this second approach, there could be 5 different Donation Items
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  that are all donations of Cash in 2001 to the Greenbelt Alliance, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  the Pivot Table will add all 5 of the Amount values and show that total
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  in the corresponding cell of the Pivot Table.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  That second approach will work smoothly if all of the Items in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  category Donation all have values for the 4 Attributes Year, Form,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Charity, and Amount.  I'm not sure what the Pivot Table code should do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  if some of the Items are missing some Attributes, or if some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Items have Amount values that are not Numbers, or if one of the Items
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  has a multi-valued Amount Attribute.  This second approach also only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  works well if the values that the user wants to see in the cell are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  things that can be totaled up, like numbers.  In some other scenarios,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  the user might not want to see the sum of a set of Attribute values, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  might instead want to see an average of the values, or see a count of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  the number of Items that fall into that cell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought of going for the second approach, which is complete and user 
</I>&gt;<i> friendly. 
</I>
Okay, sounds good.


&gt;<i> For missing information, some logic can be used to compare the 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes values and if all nonempty attribute values are matched, the 
</I>&gt;<i> missing information can be predicted. 
</I>
I don't think I understand that idea.  It sounds like a feature that you 
would add once other things are already working, so maybe we don't need 
to discuss it yet, but when the time comes maybe you can tell me more 
about the idea or give an example.


&gt;<i> Handling multiple items with same data needs to be figured out. The 
</I>&gt;<i> plugin can provide a drop down list specifying the treatment of the 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple items. For example, the drop down can have options for numeric 
</I>&gt;<i> addition, average calculation, and string addition. But this approach 
</I>&gt;<i> would not be effective if the user wants average for one axis and 
</I>&gt;<i> addition for another. I'll let you know if I find a more effective 
</I>&gt;<i> method to do this.
</I>
I like your idea of using a drop down to let the user pick different 
ways of combining values (numeric addition, average, string 
concatenation).  You could have just one drop down for the whole pivot 
table, so that the user could not pick &quot;average&quot; for one axis and 
&quot;addition&quot; for another.
