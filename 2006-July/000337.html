Hi Saurabh,

Thanks for the pointer, I hadn't realized there was demo posted that you 
can actually play with.  That's a very cool visualization tool.  I 
wonder why that demo is posted at a tools.google.com address instead of 
www.gapminder.org?

&gt;<i> They are using flash to generate it. I have a limited 
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of dojo right now but it seems to have 
</I>&gt;<i> flash support inside it so we could think of reusing 
</I>&gt;<i> the component from gapminder.
</I>
There is one Dojo package, dojo.storage, that does make use of flash. 
The dojo.storage package doesn't actually use any of the UI features of 
flash, but instead uses a feature that can save data to a cache on the 
user's local hard drive, and dojo.storage makes that feature available 
to dojo apps through a JavaScript API.

I don't know much about flash, or about how flash and JavaScript talk to 
each other.  It would be cool if we could use the gapminder component in 
JavaScript.  It would also be possible for someone to write a similar 
widget in pure JavaScript, given a year or two to work on it!

&gt;<i> p.s. My first mail to the list. Hello Everyone :-) I was 
</I>&gt;<i> designing a very similar product to open record in my previous 
</I>&gt;<i> job using proprietary technologies and hence my interest here.
</I>
Welcome to the list.  Did the company that you were at end up shipping 
that product?  I'm always interested in learning about similar tools.
