<PRE>Hi Hiran,

I'm cc'ing this message to the openrecord-dev mailing list because I 
think it might be interesting to other people (like Adam and Mignon) and 
I'm hoping to get their suggestions about different approaches.

If you decide to work on the Pivot Table next, I have some old 
JavaScript Pivot Table code that might be useful to you.  Here's the 
demo page, with two example tables:
  <A HREF="http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/test_page.html">http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/test_page.html</A>

And here are the source code files:
  <A HREF="http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/pivot_table.js">http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/pivot_table.js</A>
  <A HREF="http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/data_vortex.js">http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/data_vortex.js</A>
  <A HREF="http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/">http://openrecord.org/pivot_table/</A>

I wrote that code back in 2004 when I was first learning JavaScript, 
before I knew about Dojo, and before we started the OpenRecord project. 
  The code is old is clumsy, but it does work, so it might be useful to 
you.

For the Pivot Table, I think the biggest problem will be figuring out 
how to take the data structures of Items and Attributes and transform 
that data into something that makes sense to display in a Pivot Table. 
The first problem isn't so much a programming problem as a conceptual 
problem, or perhaps a UI design problem...

Pivot Tables work best when there are a small number of axes that can be 
pivoted (maybe 2 to 6), and where each axis has a small number of 
possible buckets (maybe 2 to 20).  On my demo page there are two example 
tables: &quot;Gas Tax Accounting&quot; and &quot;Population&quot;:
   * The Population table has 4 axes: Gender (male/female/both), 
Rural/Urban, Country (India/China/All), and Year (1948/1949).  Each axis 
has only 2 or 3 possible buckets -- for example, Country has &quot;Rural&quot;, 
&quot;Urban&quot;, and &quot;Both&quot;.
   * The Gas Tax table has only 3 axes: Year, Charity, and 
Form-of-donation.  The Year axes has 3 buckets (2001, 2002, 2003), the 
Form axes has 4 buckets (Cash, Stock, Goods, Services), and the Charity 
axis has 9 buckets.  So the Gas Tax table has a total of 108 data cells 
(3 * 4 * 9).

In OpenRecord, Items have Attributes with values, and those values can 
be strings, dates, numbers, or references to other items.  It seems to 
me that there might be more than one approach for mapping the ideas of 
Items/Attributes/values to the ideas of Axes/Buckets/cells...

Here's one approach... To display a Pivot Table with 3 axes and 108 
cells, you might populate the table from a set of 108 OpenRecord Items. 
  So, for a table like the Gas Tax table, you might have 108 Items all 
in the Category &quot;Donation&quot;, where each Donation Item has a 3 attributes 
called &quot;Year&quot;, &quot;Form&quot;, and &quot;Charity&quot;, plus an additional attribute 
called &quot;Amount&quot;.  An individual Donation Item might look like this:
   Category: Donation
   Year:     2001
   Form:     Cash
   Charity:  Greenbelt Alliance
   Amount:   $61.46

That first approach will only work well if the number of Donation Items 
is the same as the number of cells in the Pivot Table.

A better approach might be to allow for there to be many more Donation 
Items, and then have the Pivot Table automatically calculate the totals. 
  So in this second approach, there could be 5 different Donation Items 
that are all donations of Cash in 2001 to the Greenbelt Alliance, and 
the Pivot Table will add all 5 of the Amount values and show that total 
in the corresponding cell of the Pivot Table.

That second approach will work smoothly if all of the Items in the 
category Donation all have values for the 4 Attributes Year, Form, 
Charity, and Amount.  I'm not sure what the Pivot Table code should do 
if some of the Items are missing some Attributes, or if some of the 
Items have Amount values that are not Numbers, or if one of the Items 
has a multi-valued Amount Attribute.  This second approach also only 
works well if the values that the user wants to see in the cell are 
things that can be totaled up, like numbers.  In some other scenarios, 
the user might not want to see the sum of a set of Attribute values, but 
might instead want to see an average of the values, or see a count of 
the number of Items that fall into that cell.

Maybe you can think up good solutions to some of those problems.  I'll 
keep thinking about it too, and I'll let you know if I have new ideas. 
Also, maybe other people on the openrecord-dev mailing list will be able 
to propose solutions.
