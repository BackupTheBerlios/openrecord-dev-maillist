<PRE>I heard back from the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC).  Unfortunately,
they're not available to help us right now.  

But they offered a few suggestions in their reply.  I had said that we are
looking for something like the Apache license, but more liberal.  They said
the ones to look at are the MIT license and the BSD Modified license, which
is exactly what Ted Leung had said.  Unfortunately, I'm wary of both the MIT
and BSD Modified licenses, because neither of them has patent provisions.

As for setting up a contributor agreement, SFLC said doing that as a group
of individuals wasn't ideal.  Really what we want is a central legal entity,
like a foundation.  Which, again, is what had Ted said.  

In the future SFLC will be set up to give out general guidance about how to
do this stuff, but for now they suggested that we might want to look for pro
bono legal help from local law firms, law schools, or public service
organizations.  It might also be good to talk to the folks at Creative
Commons, to see what they say about using the Creative Commons licenses in
conjunction with an open source license like the Apache license.

&gt;<i> Have you heard of the Software Freedom Law Center?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">http://www.softwarefreedom.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just read a short blurb about them in Dr. Dobb's 
</I>&gt;<i> Journal, which says, in part: &quot;Among the pro bono 
</I>&gt;<i> services offered by the SFLC are license development 
</I>&gt;<i> and implementation consulting; legal consulting and 
</I>&gt;<i> lawyer training; and legal defense against litigation.
</I>
Great!  I had never heard of them before.  I just had a quick look at their
web site.  Turns out Lawrence Lessig is on their Board of Directors -- small
world!  And their whole site is under a Creative Commons License.

Shall I contact them and see if they can give us some advice?  

Or shall I wait until after we meet on Monday, once we've had a chance to
talk about what changes we want to make to the draft of the contributor
agreement?
