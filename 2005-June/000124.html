<PRE>Hi Mimi,

I'm psyched that you're exploring that question.  I'd love it if we could
come up with a simple, intuitive UI that let's people naturally transition
from an outline view to a table view without running into problems.

I've never used Omni-Outliner, so I don't know how it feels, but I like your
proposals about letting an item live in more than one place in the
hierarchy, and letting people sort on any column and having it flatten the
hierarchy and sort on all the items, not just the top-level ones.  

I think we'll have to experiment some to see what turns out to feel good and
be useful.  Unfortunately, we may be swamped for the next few weeks just
doing non-UI work to get the back-end solid, and getting our first working
&quot;dogfood&quot; site up and running smoothly enough that we actually feel safe
about saving our data in it.  But hopefully in July we'll get back to
focusing more on the UI -- cleaning up the current UI, as well as adding new
features!

Subject: rationalizing outline view with a table
	
	
Hi Brian, 

After our meeting today, I thought a little more about how to make outline
view and table view one in the same thing such that users can start out by
creating data in an outline (which is an extremely intuitive way to go about
structuring data) without regretting it afterwards.

Katie, I've cc:d you because you were the one who brought this to my
attention.

Omni-outliner also conflates an outline view with a table...however as we
discussed, it runs into a few problems:

1. If you try to sort by a column (ie. status = Done), because items are
organized in a hierarchical tree, the user can never really see all of their
Done items clumped together because Omni-Outliner refuses to break the tree.
So the best you can do is sort by the top node, which wouldn't get you very
far.

	Dinner party (Now)
	Albertson's (Now)
	Fontina (Now)
	Sparkling apple juice (Later)
	Scallions (Now)
	Marjoram (Now)
	Swordfish (Now)
	Lime (Now)
	Wine (Later)
	Order flowers (Done)
	Wash napkins (Done)
	Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)

	Restock spices (Later)
	Marjoram (Now)
	Cinnamon (Later)
	Nutmeg (Later)

2. Omni-outliner also doesn't understand about a single item living in
multiple places (ie. Marjoram lives in both Dinner party&gt;&gt;Albertson's AND
Restock spices.

Proposal: What if...You could sort for real thereby flattening out the
hierarchy. However, from any item in the list, you can open up the thread or
hierarchy that the item belongs to. 

Step 1: I've sorted the hierarchical tree above by status, therby flattening
the tree into a plain list.

	Dinner party (Now)
	Albertson's (Now)
	Fontina (Now)
	Scallions (Now)
	+ Marjoram (Now)
	Swordfish (Now)
	Lime (Now)
	Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)
	Sparkling apple juice (Later)
	Wine (Later)
	Restock spices (Later) 
	Cinnamon (Later)
	Nutmeg (Later)
	Order flowers (Done)
	Wash napkins (Done)



Step 2: I've opened the item Marjoram so I can see its hierarchical context.

	Dinner party (Now)
	Albertson's (Now)
	Fontina (Now)
	Scallions (Now)

	Dinner party (Now)
	Albertson's (Now)
	Fontina (Now)
	Sparkling apple juice (Later)
	Scallions (Now)
	- Marjoram (Now)
	Swordfish (Now)
	Lime (Now)
	Wine (Later)
	Order flowers (Done)
	Wash napkins (Done)
	Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)

	Swordfish (Now)
	Lime (Now)
	Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)
	Sparkling apple juice (Later)
	Wine (Later)
	Restock spices (Later) 
	Cinnamon (Later)
	Nutmeg (Later)
	Order flowers (Done)
	Wash napkins (Done)


Step 3: The item Marjoram actually belongs to more than 1 tree. Here, I've
chosen to view it in the context of the Dinner party tree.

	Dinner party (Now)
	Albertson's (Now)
	Fontina (Now)
	Scallions (Now)

	Restock spices (Later)
	- Marjoram (Now)
	Cinnamon (Later)
	Nutmeg (Later

	Swordfish (Now)
	Lime (Now)
	Look up Jamie's allergies (Now)
	Sparkling apple juice (Later)
	Wine (Later)
	Restock spices (Later) 
	Cinnamon (Later)
	Nutmeg (Later)
	Order flowers (Done)
	Wash napkins (Done)

This is sort of like clusters in Chandler, the only tweak is that these
would be hierarchical clusters.
