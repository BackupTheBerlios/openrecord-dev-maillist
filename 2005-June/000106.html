<PRE>Hey Chao,

|<i> &gt;  7. when you pick from a suggestion box and a new entry
</I>|<i> &gt;     is created, the entry is now a reference to the item
</I>|<i> &gt;     you picked, rather than just a text string
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> As discussed, I'll love the ability to automatically 
</I>|<i> create a new item, when the new entry is entered by 
</I>|<i> manual typing (instead of picking a auto suggestion) 
</I>|<i> on a column that has an expected data type of an item 
</I>|<i> reference.
</I>
Yup, that sounds good to me.  That should be very easy to implement, I just
didn't get that far.  Do you want to add that?  I think it just means adding
a handful of lines somewhere in TextView, but I'm still not really up to
speed with TextView.


|<i> &gt; -2. there's still no way to add a new attribute to an item
</I>|<i> &gt; -3. there's still no way to add a column to a table
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> (2) &amp; (3) are pretty closely related to each other, right? 
</I>|<i> If we add the ability to add a column (which corresponds 
</I>|<i> to an attribute type) to a table, then we have the ability 
</I>|<i> to add a new attribute to an item in that table?
</I>
Yes.  Or, if that seems like a lot of work to implement, there is also
another approach which might be good enough to meet our short term needs.
If it seemed easy to do, you could wire up DetailPlugin to use the new
MultiEntriesView code, so that we could edit entries in detail view.  Then
we would also need a little bit of extra UI that allowed you to add a new
attribute to an item in detail view, but that might be easier than adding a
column in table view.  Just an idea.


|<i> I'm interested in working on this feature but not sure 
</I>|<i> if anyone else is working on it too?
</I>
I think it'd be great if you wanted to tackle it.  But I don't know what
Mignon wants to work on next.  I'm planning on mostly just resting on my
laurels until Monday.  I'm going to do some non-progamming tasks, and
possibly do some pair programming with Mignon on Saturday on whatever she's
working on.
