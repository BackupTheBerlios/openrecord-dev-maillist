<PRE>Hi Chao,

That all sounds great to me.

On point (4)...  

If we decide to show multiple entries on a single line, then Mimi's
suggestion of a light grey dot sounds good.  Alternatively, we could have
each entry appear on a new line, and we could visually separate the entries
using a light grey line element.  I have a slight preference for having the
entries on separate lines, but I think it's hard to know which is a better
look and feel without trying out one of them.  
  
I think having the entries on separate lines may be easier to implement,
because the text-wrapping cases can be handled locally within a single
EntryView (aka TextView), rather than having text-wrapping maybe be an issue
that impacts the MultiEntriesView and two or more EntryViews.

On point (5) ...

Maybe on Monday we can talk about that list of UI questions and try to come
up with some answers.  

On Sunday Mignon and I talked about a lot of UI details, including some of
the table view UI.  Here's a quick summary of the ideas we talked about for
the table UI:

 - single click on a table row == select entire row
 - hit delete when row is selected == delete item
 - copy &amp; paste when row is selected == copy &amp; paste item

 - single click on an entry in a selected row == select an entry
 - hit delete when an entry is selected == delete entry
 - copy &amp; paste when entry is selected == copy &amp; paste entry

 - double click on an entry == start editing entry
 - when a table cell has only one entry, selecting the entry maybe feels
just like selecting the cell?
 - when you have one entry selected, or are editing one entry, you can
create a new entry by hitting &quot;alt-&lt;return&gt;/&lt;enter&gt;&quot; -- maybe we should also
have a small button in the cell (e.g. [*]), so you can use the button to
create a new entry  -- the button would only appear in the cell when you
were editing an entry

Subject: [openrecord-dev] Multi entries support for table cells


Hi, 

OK, I'm thinking about supporting multiple entries in a table cell.

Here's what I propose:
1) Create a new view MultiEntriesView (looking for a better name) that
shadows a HTMLCellElement.This view displays all the entries of a given item
for a given attribute. It can also be used outside of TablePlugin. 

2) Inside a MultiEntriesView, we have one or more views representing an
Entry of the item's attribute. We will use TextView for this purpose. Over
time, we should adapt TextView to be something like EntryView, where it
accepts not just a text string, but item references, URLs, images, etc.

3) Brian suggests that if a MultiEntriesView has focus (or one of its
sub-views), and you type &quot;alt-&lt;return&gt;/&lt;enter&gt;&quot; it creates a new EntryView
within the MultiEntriesView. This is how a user creates multiple entries
within an item attribute.

4) Within a MultiEntriesView, multiple entries are separated by some
delimiter e.g. Mimi suggested &quot; . &quot;

5) We need to figure out what UI changes need to be made to support multiple
entries in a table cell. e.g.
- is a table cell still a unit of selection as opposed to an entry in a
cell?
- how do you navigate between entries and cells on the keyboard?
- should there be other affordances to create a new entry?
- what does clicking on the separator between entries do?
- when sorting table columns, do we just use the first entry for that cell?
- etc. probably a bunch of other unanswered questions

6) Given alternatives for (5), I'm still thinking of a graceful way of
implementing keypress handling for our system in general. Ideally, I'll like
a system where the focused TextView or EntryView gets to handle a keypress,
if it's not handled, then it passes it up to the superview. For TablePlugin,
this would be MultiEntriesView. If it's not handled at MultiEntriesView,
then TablePlugin gets to handle it and so on. If you have ideas on how to
implement this, or want to brainstorm with me, please ping me.

Thanks,
chao
