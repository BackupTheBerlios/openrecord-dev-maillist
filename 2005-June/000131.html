<PRE>Hi Chao,

Thanks for sending this out. I think this will be useful in our  
efforts to sell the Sidebar design too. See more comments in-line.  
(Do you think this is worth posting to the OSAF lists?)

Mimi



I know how a specific very large successful company organizes itself  
to get its work done.

I realized this morning that Instant Outlining would allow you to  
model the reporting relationships in a real-world comapny and you  
could actually get most of it's business done with it.

Microsoft is built around its mail servers. Every employee in a  
development position gets a blizzard of tens to hundreds of emails  
every day. They have to pay attention to the email flow, ignore the  
messages that don't apply to them and act on those that are important  
for them, respond to those that request assistance, and file those  
that might be important in the future.

------

It seems like one of the biggest gripes people at Microsft have is  
the indiscriminate use of lists. People don't think carefully about  
who actually really needs to read the email carefully and respond to  
it versus the people who just need to know on an fyi basis versus the  
people who should have access to the information on a need to to know  
basis. Any group communications solution needs to encourage SENDERS  
to draw those fine distinctions.

Right now, RECEIVERS are burdened with that task. Some people have  
clear enough boundaries of responsibilities that they are able to do  
that via rules. Most people do it manually. However, the hans-down  
best person to distinguish between those that need to know and those  
that really need to know is the SENDER. That alone would probably cut  
down most people's email by 50-70%.

------


In many ways the whole effort would work better if it were built on  
Instant Outlining.

The overhead to talk to your own team members is really reduced. You  
open a new outline subhead that's time stamped. You type the names of  
the folks you'd like to pay attention at the front of the subhead,  
like the salutation of a letter, type your thoughts and press Ctrl-S  
to save it so your thought is transmitted instantly to your subscribers.


------

Hmmm, I'm thinking there still needs to be a notification system that  
distinguishes between capital-N (aka I'm ready for comments and  
responses) v. small-n (aka Look at it if you want, but please hold  
questions until the end.) The fear of being inundated with  
unsolicitied replies when you're not quite ready to share your  
thoughts will stifle people such that they won't address drafts and  
make them available to other people until they're absolutely ready.

------

Sending emails seems way more formal and always seems to take longer  
because you have the overhead of cooking up a title and figuring out  
how to address it. When you type in your outline you are  
automatically addressing your newly typed subhead to all of your co- 
workers who care about what you are saying

With email, you have to wait for the sender to get all of his  
thoughts into the message before he can send it. With an Instant  
Outline your coworker can let you watch him put his thoughts together  
by saving his outline as he composes it. Your subscribers can digest  
the early part of your thinking and give you a faster response once  
you are all done.

------

How do they know when you're all done?

------


You focus attention on what your open issues are by leaving subheads  
in your outline open and close them when you are satisfied. The  
outline is a permanent, searchable entity that records your thoughts  
like an email queue would, but it starts out and remains in a  
structure that gives it more permanence and context than an email queue.

------

I guess this is the equivalent of triage status? I wonder if the open  
v. closed-ness of any one section it's shared. It also seems annoying  
that you would have to leave the entire tree open in order to view a  
single open issue that was really deep in the tree. Maybe I'm not  
interpreting what he's saying correctly. But he's pointing out a need  
to distinguish between open and resolved issues.

------


A subdomain is a directory that stores the personal outlines that a  
group of coworkers maintain for their mutual benefit. Each outline is  
available for subscription by the other members at their discretion.

Here's how Microsoft could be modeled using Instant Outlining  
software that can access multiple subdomains.

Bill Gates and Sterve Ballmer's direct reports would mostly be the  
folks that they subscribed to with an Instant Outliner. Those  
outlines would be hosted in Office of the Chairman and Office of the  
CEO subdomains.

When they needed a temporary look deep in the organization, they  
would subscribe to someone in an operating group to listen to their  
opinion and then would unsub later on, trusting that the operating  
groups would pass important stuff up to them when they weren't paying  
attention to that level of detail.


------

This is how I imagined Mitch might subscribe to shared collections  
maintained by Sheila, Philippe, Katie and Lisa and shared with their  
respective teams, as a way to gain better insight into current  
discussions, specs, etc. This would also be a good way for the  
community to keep up-to-date on OSAF progress without having to slug  
through the wiki, both mailing lists and IRC.

------


For leaders of large groups, Instant outlining has the very cool  
feature that you can allow folks to subscribe to you so that they can  
see what you are thinking about. The leader does not necessarily  
subscribe to everyone who subscribes to him because that would  
overwhelm his thinking process. But those who get to subscribe to one  
of his Instant Outlines get quite an informational advantage and can  
work better on their own goals because they have that.

If you're organized around email, usually the only folks who get to  
listen are the folks who are direct reports. And those guys are  
always too busy to pass much info down.

The leaders also get to monitor activity in any of the subdomains of  
the company. They would subscribe to outlines in different groups of  
the company at their pleasure, but since they are not intimately  
familar with those groups business they would not want immediate  
notification of changes made to those person's outlines. They can see  
all the way down to the bottom of the company if they wish to. That's  
been a near impossibility up to now with the communication tools that  
have been available.

OK. now were going to go down to the individual development groups  
and work our way back up to Bill and Steve. Keep in mind this is not  
describing what Microsoft curently does, but what they could do if  
they used an Instant Outliner.

In a software development setting, one developer might post to  
outlines in 10 to 15 subdomains.

A programmer on the Word team would keep an outline on his feature  
team's subdomain and another one on the subdomain dedicated to the  
entire Word project. When he has a comment relevant to his feature  
team coworkers/buddies who he works with most closely, he adds  
something to that outline. And when he has something to say that the  
whole product team needs to hear he posts to that outline.


------

This is sounding a lot like a discussion board with the added  
functionality of addressing comments to specific people.

------

He might also keep outlines for communcation with feature teams over  
in the Excel and Exchange development groups in Office because those  
teams need to have someone in Word who is conversant with what they  
are doing and they value his comments. He might have special  
expertise in particular technologies (Office subsystems, HTML editing  
controls, dialog managers, format converters) that are used widely  
with the company.

He would have a different outline subdomain for each of his  
responsibilities. His OPML Editor would maintain a Buddies header  
that lists each subdomain he subscribes to and the subheads within  
would show the personal outlines for those co-workers he's subscribed  
to.

The team leads would have their own subdomain for communication with  
the project lead and probably also get to listen in on the  
discussions that happen in the business unit managers personal  
subdomain.

Business unit managers would maintain outlines in a company wide  
business unit managers subdomain and in a subdomain for all the  
reports of the vice-president who is their boss. These unit managers  
might silently be able to monitor outlines from several levels down  
in the organization but don't want to be notified of every change to  
outlines and would not expect that those folks would be able to  
subscribe to his own personal subdomains.

Those vice-presidents are Steve Ballmer's direct reports and keep  
outlines in the Office of the CEO subdomain.

------

I'm trying to visualize how you would keep track of new items being  
added all over the various outlines you're subscribed to.
