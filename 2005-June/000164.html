<PRE>Hey Gang,

I've been working hard on the axiomatic items and the JSON repository
format, and today I reached what I think is a fairly stable first draft.  

With the repository format beginning to settle down, I moved on to working
on a prototype &quot;template&quot; for our dogfood site.  By &quot;template&quot;, I mean a
site that has categories for bugs and tasks and whatnot, and has pages and
tables set up to show the tasks, but that isn't actually populated with
hundreds of tasks. 

There's good news and bad news...

The good news is that I was able to create a first dogfood template site in
under half an hour.  OpenRecord feels pretty powerful and easy to use.  I
feel good about where we're headed.

The bad news is that the dogfood repository file is already over 100 KB,
even though we haven't started populating it with bugs and tasks and
whatnot.  And the dogfood site is sluggish, even on my fast Intel machine.
Most pages load in less than a second, but a page with a hundred entries on
it takes nearly 3 seconds to load.  So it looks like we're going to have to
start working on performance issues sooner rather than later.

I checked the dogfood template into subversion, and I posted it on the
openrecord web site.  Here's the URL, if you want to check it out:
