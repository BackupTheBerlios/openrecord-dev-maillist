<PRE>Hey Gang,

Ever since we set up our Subversion server and started do check-ins, we've
been putting all the code we write under a Creative Commons Public Domain
Dedication.  And similarly, all the messages we post to the dev list are
marked as public domain.

I think the Public Domain Dedication is a good choice for us.  I'm not a
lawyer or an expert on intellectual property issues, but my understanding is
that the public domain dedication gives us a huge amount of flexibility in
how we can use the work we do.  

For example, with the public domain dedication, I think at any point you can
copy all the code and make a few changes to it, thereby creating a
derivative work.  And then you can copyright the derivative work, all rights
reserved, and license it under any propriety license you want, or any open
source license you want.

And I think the public domain dedication also makes it easier to contribute
code to other open source projects.  Because all our code is public domain,
my understanding is that any other project can take little scraps without
having to deal with keeping track of licensing and attribution issues.  For
example, if a programmer at OSAF is working on Scooby, they can look through
the OpenRecord code to see how we do pop-up suggestion lists, and then they
can copy a few methods or a few files, re-work it to meet their needs, and
incorporate it in the Scooby code base under the OSAF copyright and license
terms.  Similarly, if we wanted the whole OpenRecord project to get
assimilated into the MediaWiki project, I believe that having our work in
the public domain should make that easier. 

But, the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication only covers the copyright
issues.  We also need to worry about patent rights for the work we create.
And we need to worry about keeping track of the patent and copyright license
terms for code that we get from other open source authors. 

In the past week I've spent a bunch of time looking at how other open source
projects handle all this stuff.  I've been looking at the &quot;contributor
agreements&quot; and license agreements used Apache, Mozilla, Zope, etc.  There
are lots of good ideas to draw on, but unfortunately everybody seems to do
things a little bit differently.  And we face a further complication,
because unlike Apache, Mozilla, and Zope, for our project there's no single
company or foundation that can own the work and control the license.  

This stuff is all a little bit complicated, and it'd be good to talk to a
lawyer about it and get some expert advice.  I've seen companies spend
millions of dollars just on legal fees, on intellectual property lawsuits
that could probably have been prevented if the original authors had been
careful to get all their ducks in a row in the first few months of the
project.

For our project, it seems like either we need to (a) create some kind of
little non-profit foundation to serve as a legal umbrella, (b) operate as a
project of some existing foundation, like the Tides Foundation or OSAF, or
(c) set up some kind of contributor license agreement that works just
between all of the individual contributors.

My first inclination was to try approach (c), because it seemed simpler and
cheaper than (a) or (b).  This past week I took a stab at trying to draft a
contributor agreement that might work for our project.  Have a look at it
when you get a chance, and we can talk about it next time we're all
together!

                   The OpenRecord Software Project
             Contributor License Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;)
                   <A HREF="http://openrecord.org/licenses/">http://openrecord.org/licenses/</A>

                   
Thank you for contributing to The OpenRecord Software Project. In order to
clearly establish the intellectual property license granted with
Contributions, we need to have a Contributor License Agreement that has been
signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.
This Agreement is for the protection of all of the Contributors, as well as
the protection of the users of the Work. Please read this document carefully
before signing and keep a copy for your records.


This multiparty agreement is entered into among Brian Douglas Skinner,
Chih-Chao Lam, Mignon Belongie, (ALSO?: Mimi and Marty), and the subsequent
undersigned Contributors. In consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements, provisions and covenants contained herein, the parties agree as
follows:



                                    RECITALS
                                    
The OpenRecord Software Project is an open source software development
project.  The primary OpenRecord product is a collaborative web tool,
similar in concept to a wiki (the most famous example of which is
wikipedia.org). However, unlike a wiki, which is primarily text based,
OpenRecord is designed to enable web sites that allow people to create, add
information to, reorganize, link together, search and otherwise use charts,
tables, databases, and other ways of organizing information. More
information can be found at <A HREF="http://openrecord.org.">http://openrecord.org.</A>  

The Contributors to the OpenRecord Software Project intend to use the
resulting OpenRecord Work in a wide variety of ways. Different Contributors
intend to use the work in different ways. The Contributors wish to ensure
that they, and others, retain broad and sweeping freedoms to Fully Utilize
the OpenRecord Work. One of the goals of this Agreement is to help ensure
that the OpenRecord Work is not contaminated with Contributions of GNU GPL
source code or Contributions of proprietary intellectual property that would
restrict how the OpenRecord Work could be used.



SECTION 1.     Definition of Terms. 

The following definitions apply throughout this Agreement:

1.1. &quot;Agreement&quot; (or &quot;Contributor License Agreement&quot;)
     means this agreement.

1.2. &quot;Contributor&quot; 
     means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and
complying with all of the terms of, this Agreement. For legal entities, the
entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered
to be a single Contributor. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
ownership of such entity.

1.3. &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;)
     means the Contributor that is indicating agreement to these terms by
completing and executing this Agreement.
     
1.4. &quot;Other Contributors&quot;
     means the Contributors who have executed this Agreement before or after
You executed it.

1.5. &quot;Creation&quot;

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your
Contribution, or the OpenRecord Work to which you have contributed,
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution
or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

You hereby agree not to Submit Contributions of Copied Work that might in
any way jeopardize the ability of the Other Contributors to freely copy,
distribute, modify, use, offer to sell, or sell the OpenRecord Work. You
