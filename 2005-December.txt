Hi Rowan,

There's a good discussion taking place on the dojo developer mailing list.
If you're not too busy, you might be interested in keeping tabs on it, or
jumping in.  

The conversation is about dojo building a general purpose data-provider API,
with bindings to different UI widgets, and bindings to different server
content stores.  I think this may be a very positive development for the
OpenRecord project, and we may want to design our whole server/data-store
layer around it.

The dojo project has a couple mailing lists: the dojo-interest list, and the
ng-dhtml developer list...  

  The dojo-interest list is pretty high volume, with hundreds of subscribers
and hundreds of message per month, largely about using dojo widgets.  You
probably wouldn't want to subscribe unless you're actively using dojo
widgets, but I'm finding it a wonderful resource, given all the dojo stuff
I've been doing lately.  

  The developer list (ng-dhtml) is much lower volume, with dozens of
subscribers and dozens of message per month, mostly about developing the
dojo code itself, rather than using it.  Have a look at the whole
data-provider thread, and if you're interested you can subscribe to the
list:

Subject: [openrecord-dev] Dabble clips
Message-ID: <200512192242.jBJMg9019824@bat.berlios.de>

I haven't yet been able to try out Dabble, but everything I see about it
looks great.  Here are a couple of good 2-minute video clips about Dabble...

The first one shows how you can take a simple text field and convert the
values from being text to being references to other items ("entries"), with
inverse fields that point back to the original item ("entry"):

The second one shows a table view with a nice UI for sorting and grouping
and such:
